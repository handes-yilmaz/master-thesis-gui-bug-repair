        "explanation": "1. **src/language-js/printer-estree.js**: This file is likely responsible for the printing logic of JavaScript code in Prettier. The bug report indicates an issue with how parentheses are handled in the output, which suggests that the logic for determining when to keep or remove parentheses is located here. The comments in the compressed content mention handling of parentheses and decorators, which aligns with the issue described in the bug report.\n\n2. **src/language-js/needs-parens.js**: This file contains logic related to determining when parentheses are necessary. The bug involves parentheses being incorrectly removed, so this file is crucial for understanding and potentially fixing the logic that decides when parentheses should be preserved. The comments in the compressed content discuss various scenarios where parentheses are needed, indicating that this file plays a role in the decision-making process for parentheses retention.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Prettier code formatter incorrectly removing parentheses around an object when using JSDoc with the `@satisfies` tag. The expected behavior is to retain the parentheses to ensure proper intellisense functionality. The provided example shows that the input code with parentheses is transformed into output code without parentheses, which breaks intellisense."
