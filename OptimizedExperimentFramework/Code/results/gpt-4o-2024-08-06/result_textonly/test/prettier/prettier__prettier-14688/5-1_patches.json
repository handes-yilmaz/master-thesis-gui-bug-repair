    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the trailing comma in the generic arguments list is preserved in the output. The bug report indicates that the trailing comma is being removed, which is not the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe image provided in the bug report shows a TypeScript function with a generic parameter `<T,>`. The trailing comma is required by the compiler, but the output generated by Prettier removes this comma. This suggests that the code responsible for printing TypeScript nodes is not correctly handling the trailing comma in generic parameter lists.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe relevant code for handling TypeScript nodes is located in `src/language-js/print/typescript.js`. The function `printTypescript` is responsible for printing various TypeScript nodes, including type parameters. The specific case for handling type parameters is likely where the issue lies.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the trailing comma is preserved when printing type parameters. We will modify the `printTypeParameters` function call to include the trailing comma if it is present in the input.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/typescript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncase \"TSTypeParameterDeclaration\":\ncase \"TSTypeParameterInstantiation\":\n  return printTypeParameters(path, options, print, \"params\");\n=======\ncase \"TSTypeParameterDeclaration\":\ncase \"TSTypeParameterInstantiation\":\n  return printTypeParameters(path, options, print, \"params\", true);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nIn this patch, we add an additional argument `true` to the `printTypeParameters` function call, which will instruct the function to preserve the trailing comma if it exists. This change should ensure that the output matches the expected behavior described in the bug report."
