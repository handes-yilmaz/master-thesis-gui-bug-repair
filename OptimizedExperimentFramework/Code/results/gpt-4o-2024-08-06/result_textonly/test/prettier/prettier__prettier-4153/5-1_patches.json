    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to modify the code to correctly detect the language of fenced code blocks even when additional attributes are present. The problem is that the current implementation fails to recognize the language if there are non-whitespace characters following the language identifier in a fenced code block.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario image and the report indicate that the Prettier tool is not correctly formatting code blocks when additional attributes are present after the language identifier. The expected behavior is that the language should be detected correctly, and the code block should be formatted as if the attributes were not present.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is that the current parser does not account for additional attributes following the language identifier in fenced code blocks. The parser should be updated to ignore any text after the language identifier when determining the language of the code block.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `parse` function within the `src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js` file. We need to update the parsing logic to correctly handle the language detection by ignoring any attributes following the language identifier.\n\n### Patch\nWe will modify the `parse` function to correctly detect the language by ignoring any additional attributes. Here's the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-markdown/parser-markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction parse(text /*, parsers, opts*/) {\n  const processor = unified()\n    .use(remarkParse, { footnotes: true, commonmark: true })\n    .use(remarkFrontmatter, [\"yaml\", \"toml\"])\n    .use(restoreUnescapedCharacter(text))\n    .use(mergeContinuousTexts)\n    .use(transformInlineCode)\n    .use(splitText);\n  return processor.runSync(processor.parse(text));\n}\n=======\nfunction parse(text /*, parsers, opts*/) {\n  const processor = unified()\n    .use(remarkParse, { footnotes: true, commonmark: true })\n    .use(remarkFrontmatter, [\"yaml\", \"toml\"])\n    .use(restoreUnescapedCharacter(text))\n    .use(mergeContinuousTexts)\n    .use(transformInlineCode)\n    .use(splitText)\n    .use(detectLanguageWithAttributes);\n  return processor.runSync(processor.parse(text));\n}\n\nfunction detectLanguageWithAttributes() {\n  return ast => map(ast, node => {\n    if (node.type === \"code\" && node.lang) {\n      // Extract the language ignoring any attributes\n      const [language] = node.lang.split(/\\s+/);\n      return Object.assign({}, node, { lang: language });\n    }\n    return node;\n  });\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We added a new function `detectLanguageWithAttributes` that processes the AST to correctly detect the language of code blocks by splitting the `lang` property on whitespace and taking the first part as the language.\n- This function is added to the processing pipeline in the `parse` function to ensure that it is applied to the AST before any further processing.\n- This change ensures that any attributes following the language identifier in fenced code blocks are ignored, allowing the language to be detected correctly."
