    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that empty lines in the `blogs` section of the markdown YAML frontmatter are not removed. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify the root cause and generate the necessary patches.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Images and Root Cause:**\n   - The bug report indicates that empty lines in the `blogs` section are being removed when processed by the markdown parser.\n   - The root cause is likely related to how the frontmatter is being parsed and how the content is being reconstructed after parsing.\n\n2. **Bug Code Snippets Analysis:**\n   - The `parse.js` file contains a function `parse` that uses a regular expression to match and parse the frontmatter.\n   - The `parse` function returns an object with `frontMatter` and `content`. The `content` is reconstructed by replacing non-newline characters with spaces and appending the rest of the text.\n   - The `front-matter.js` file uses the `parseFrontMatter` function to tokenize the frontmatter.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue seems to be in the `parse.js` file, specifically in how the `content` is reconstructed. The current implementation replaces all non-newline characters with spaces, which can lead to the removal of empty lines. We need to ensure that the empty lines are preserved.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### src/utils/front-matter/parse.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  return {\n    frontMatter,\n    content: raw.replaceAll(/[^\\\\n]/g, \" \") + text.slice(raw.length),\n  };\n=======\n  return {\n    frontMatter,\n    content: raw.replaceAll(/[^\\n]/g, \" \").replace(/^\\s*$/gm, \"\") + text.slice(raw.length),\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- The patch modifies the `content` reconstruction logic in the `parse` function.\n- It adds a `.replace(/^\\s*$/gm, \"\")` to remove lines that consist only of spaces, effectively preserving empty lines in the original content.\n- This change ensures that the empty lines in the `blogs` section are not removed during the parsing process."
