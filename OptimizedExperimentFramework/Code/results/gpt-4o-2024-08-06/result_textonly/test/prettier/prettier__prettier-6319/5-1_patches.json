    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, let's break down the steps:\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario**: The bug report indicates that the Prettier parser is throwing a `SyntaxError` when encountering the `#` character in the pipeline operator syntax `5 |> # * 2`. The expected behavior is for the parser to support the \"smart\" proposal of the pipeline operator, which allows for the use of `#` as a placeholder.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The root cause of the issue is that the parser is currently configured to support only the \"minimal\" proposal of the pipeline operator, which does not include support for the `#` placeholder. This is evident from the configuration in the `babelOptions` function where the pipeline operator is set with `{ proposal: \"minimal\" }`.\n\n### Bug Localization and Fix\n\nThe bug is located in the `src/language-js/parser-babel.js` file, specifically in the `babelOptions` function where the pipeline operator plugin is configured.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to change the pipeline operator configuration from the \"minimal\" proposal to the \"smart\" proposal. Here is the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/parser-babel.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      [\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"minimal\" }],\n=======\n      [\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"smart\" }],\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change updates the configuration to support the \"smart\" proposal, which should allow the parser to handle the `#` character as expected in the pipeline operator syntax."
