        "explanation": "1. **src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js**: This file is likely responsible for the logic that handles the printing or formatting of markdown content. Given the issue is with how markdown tables are being formatted, this file would contain the relevant code that needs to be adjusted to prevent the creation of excessively long lines.\n\n2. **src/doc/doc-printer.js**: This file contains the logic for printing documents, including handling line breaks and whitespace. The bug report mentions issues with line length and formatting, which suggests that the logic in this file might need to be adjusted to handle markdown tables differently, ensuring that lines do not become excessively long.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Prettier tool excessively lengthening lines when formatting markdown tables, particularly those containing HTML, such as all-contributors tables. This results in very long lines, which are not ideal for readability or maintainability. The desired behavior is to detect such cases and revert to a simpler three-dash pattern for table formatting, avoiding the creation of excessively long lines."
