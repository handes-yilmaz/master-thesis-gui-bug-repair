        "explanation": "The bug is related to the handling of markdown tables, specifically the formatting of long lines in tables. The file 'src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js' likely contains the logic for printing markdown structures, including tables. The 'MarkdownPrinter' class and the 'printTable' function are probable candidates for where the markdown table formatting logic resides. Since the issue is with how tables are processed and formatted, these elements are directly linked to the bug and would need to be modified to implement the desired behavior of limiting line lengths and using a simpler formatting style when necessary.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the markdown table formatting when processed by the Prettier tool. The problem occurs when handling tables with very long lines, such as those found in markdown files containing HTML content (e.g., all-contributors tables). The Prettier tool currently does not limit the length of table lines, leading to excessively long lines that are not properly formatted. The desired behavior is for Prettier to detect such cases and revert to a simpler table formatting style using the three-dash pattern to ensure better readability."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to how markdown tables are processed, specifically in maintaining the formatting of tables without generating excessively long lines. The file 'src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js' is responsible for handling markdown syntax and table processing. The comments in the compressed file mention various markdown-related processing tasks, such as handling leading characters, indented and fenced code blocks, and whitespace. These are likely related to the issue of handling markdown tables, making this file a key element in addressing the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Prettier tool's handling of markdown files. Specifically, when Prettier processes markdown tables, particularly those containing HTML (such as all-contributors tables), it results in excessively long lines, sometimes up to 865 characters. The suggestion is to detect such cases and revert to a simpler three-dash pattern for table formatting, instead of maintaining the long lines."
