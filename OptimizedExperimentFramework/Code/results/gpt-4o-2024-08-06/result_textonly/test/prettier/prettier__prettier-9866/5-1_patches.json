    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the unstable JSX formatting issue with the Unicode character \\u3000. The bug report indicates that the formatting is inconsistent, leading to different outputs when the code is processed multiple times.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe bug scenario involves JSX formatting where the Unicode character \\u3000 (a full-width space) is used. The expected behavior is for the formatting to remain stable across multiple runs, but the current implementation results in inconsistent formatting. The provided image shows a GIF of the formatting changing between runs, which confirms the instability.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to how whitespace, particularly non-standard whitespace like \\u3000, is handled in the JSX formatting logic. The code needs to ensure that such characters are consistently treated, especially when determining line breaks and whitespace handling.\n\n### Bug Localization\n\nThe relevant code for handling JSX children and whitespace is found in the `printJsxElementInternal` and `printJSXChildren` functions within the `src/language-js/print/jsx.js` file. These functions are responsible for managing how JSX elements and their children are printed, including handling whitespace and line breaks.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the handling of whitespace, including \\u3000, is consistent. This involves modifying the logic that processes JSX children and whitespace to account for non-standard whitespace characters.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/jsx.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const rawJsxWhitespace = options.singleQuote ? \"{\\' \\'}\" : '{\" \"}';\n  const jsxWhitespace = isMdxBlock\n    ? concat([\" \"])\n    : ifBreak(concat([rawJsxWhitespace, softline]), \" \");\n=======\n  const rawJsxWhitespace = options.singleQuote ? \"{\\' \\'}\" : '{\" \"}';\n  const jsxWhitespace = isMdxBlock\n    ? concat([\" \"])\n    : ifBreak(concat([rawJsxWhitespace, softline]), \" \");\n\n  // Handle full-width space (U+3000) consistently\n  const fullWidthSpace = \"\\u3000\";\n  const jsxFullWidthWhitespace = ifBreak(concat([`{\"${fullWidthSpace}\"}`, softline]), fullWidthSpace);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/jsx.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const children = printJSXChildren(\n    path,\n    options,\n    print,\n    jsxWhitespace,\n    isFacebookTranslationTag\n  );\n=======\n  const children = printJSXChildren(\n    path,\n    options,\n    print,\n    jsxWhitespace,\n    isFacebookTranslationTag\n  ).map(child => {\n    // Ensure full-width spaces are handled consistently\n    if (typeof child === 'string' && child.includes(fullWidthSpace)) {\n      return child.replace(new RegExp(fullWidthSpace, 'g'), jsxFullWidthWhitespace);\n    }\n    return child;\n  });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Whitespace Handling**: We introduced a new constant `fullWidthSpace` to represent the Unicode character \\u3000. We then defined `jsxFullWidthWhitespace` to ensure that this character is consistently handled, similar to how regular spaces are managed.\n\n2. **Children Processing**: In the `printJSXChildren` function, we map over the children to replace occurrences of the full-width space with the consistent handling defined by `jsxFullWidthWhitespace`.\n\nThese changes ensure that the formatting remains stable, even when non-standard whitespace characters are present, addressing the instability described in the bug report."
