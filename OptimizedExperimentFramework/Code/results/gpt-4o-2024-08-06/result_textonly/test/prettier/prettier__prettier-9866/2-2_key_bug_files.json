        "explanation": "The file 'src/language-js/print/jsx.js' is responsible for handling the formatting of JSX elements. The comments in the compressed bug file indicate that it deals with how JSX children are expanded and formatted, including handling whitespace and line breaks. The issue described in the bug report is directly related to how whitespace (specifically the \\u3000 character) is being handled inconsistently in JSX formatting. Therefore, this file is likely where the bug resides, as it contains logic for managing JSX formatting and whitespace handling.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves unstable JSX formatting when using the Unicode character \\u3000 (ideographic space) in JSX elements. The Prettier formatter is expected to maintain consistent formatting, but it alternates between two different outputs when formatting the same JSX code. The expected behavior is for the formatting to remain stable and consistent, regardless of the presence of \\u3000."
