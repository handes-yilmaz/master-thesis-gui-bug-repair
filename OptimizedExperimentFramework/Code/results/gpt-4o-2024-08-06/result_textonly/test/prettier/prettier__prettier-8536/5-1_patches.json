    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that Prettier does not add an extra newline at the end of a file when the file consists of a directive followed by a comment. The bug is likely related to how Prettier handles trailing newlines in its document printing logic.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image and details indicate that when a file contains only a directive followed by a comment, Prettier incorrectly adds an extra newline at the end of the file. This behavior is not expected, as the output should match the input format without additional newlines.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is likely in the logic that handles the printing of newlines in the document. Specifically, the `printDocToString` function in `src/document/doc-printer.js` is responsible for converting the document structure into a string, and it may be adding an extra newline when it encounters a directive followed by a comment.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `printDocToString` function in `src/document/doc-printer.js`. We need to adjust the logic to ensure that an extra newline is not added when the document ends with a comment.\n\n### Patches\nHere are the patches to fix the bug:\n\n```javascript\n### src/document/doc-printer.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nif (lineSuffix.length) {\n  cmds.push([ind, mode, doc]);\n  cmds.push(...lineSuffix.reverse());\n  lineSuffix = [];\n  break;\n}\n=======\nif (lineSuffix.length) {\n  cmds.push([ind, mode, doc]);\n  cmds.push(...lineSuffix.reverse());\n  lineSuffix = [];\n  break;\n} else if (cmds.length === 0 && out.length > 0 && out[out.length - 1] === newLine) {\n  // Remove the extra newline if the document ends with a comment\n  out.pop();\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that if the document ends with a comment, the extra newline is removed, aligning the output with the expected behavior. The logic checks if the `cmds` stack is empty and the last element in the `out` array is a newline, then removes it. This prevents the addition of an unnecessary newline at the end of the document."
