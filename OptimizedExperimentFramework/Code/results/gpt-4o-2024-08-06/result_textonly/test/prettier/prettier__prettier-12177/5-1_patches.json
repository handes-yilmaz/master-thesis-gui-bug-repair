    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that comments following `case` and `default` statements in a `switch` block are formatted consistently. The bug report indicates that the current formatting results in different outcomes for `case` and `default` comments, which is not the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario images and the bug report suggest that the issue arises from how comments are handled in `switch` statements, particularly after `case` and `default` labels. The expected behavior is for comments to remain inline with the `case` or `default` label, rather than being moved to a new line.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe relevant code snippets are located in the `src/language-js/printer-estree.js` and `src/language-js/print/statement.js` files. The function `printSwitchCaseConsequent` in `statement.js` is responsible for printing the consequent of a switch case, which is where the formatting issue likely originates.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that comments following `case` and `default` labels are printed inline. This involves modifying the `printSwitchCaseConsequent` function to handle comments correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/statement.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print) {\n  return printStatementSequence(path, options, print, \"consequent\");\n}\n=======\nfunction printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print) {\n  const node = path.getValue();\n  const parts = [];\n\n  if (node.consequent.length === 0) {\n    // Handle comments after case/default\n    const comments = path.getComments();\n    if (comments && comments.length > 0) {\n      parts.push(\" \", printDanglingComments(path, options, true));\n    }\n  }\n\n  parts.push(printStatementSequence(path, options, print, \"consequent\"));\n  return parts;\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `printSwitchCaseConsequent` function is modified to check if the `consequent` array is empty, which indicates that there are no statements following the `case` or `default` label.\n- If there are comments present, they are printed inline with the label using `printDanglingComments`.\n- This ensures that comments remain on the same line as the `case` or `default` label, maintaining the expected formatting.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring consistent formatting for comments in `switch` statements, aligning with the expected behavior described in the bug report."
