    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to revert the addition of spaces in Angular Pipes formatting. The bug report indicates that the current behavior of adding spaces around pipe arguments is not desired, and the expected behavior is to have no spaces between the pipe name and its arguments when they are strings or numbers.\n\nLet's analyze the provided code snippets to identify where the formatting logic for Angular Pipes is implemented and make the necessary changes.\n\n### Analysis of Bug Code Snippets\n\n1. **File: `src/language-js/print/angular.js`**\n\n   This file contains the function `printAngular`, which handles the printing of various Angular node types. The relevant case for us is `NGPipeExpression`, which is responsible for printing Angular pipe expressions. The function `printBinaryishExpression` is called for this case, which likely contains the logic for formatting pipe expressions.\n\n2. **File: `src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js`**\n\n   This file deals with Angular interpolation, using a regex to identify interpolation expressions. The function `printAngularInterpolation` formats these expressions, but it doesn't seem directly related to the pipe formatting issue described in the bug report.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe bug is likely located in the `printBinaryishExpression` function, which is called for `NGPipeExpression` nodes in `src/language-js/print/angular.js`. We need to modify this function to ensure that spaces are not added around pipe arguments when they are strings or numbers.\n\n### Generate Patches\n\nLet's create a patch for the `src/language-js/print/angular.js` file to address the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/angular.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncase \"NGPipeExpression\":\n  return printBinaryishExpression(path, options, print);\n=======\ncase \"NGPipeExpression\":\n  return printBinaryishExpression(path, options, print, {\n    noSpaceForStringOrNumber: true,\n  });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nAssuming `printBinaryishExpression` is defined elsewhere, we need to modify it to accept an options parameter that allows us to control the spacing behavior. If `printBinaryishExpression` is not defined in the provided snippets, you would need to locate its definition and apply a similar change to handle the `noSpaceForStringOrNumber` option.\n\nThis patch introduces an additional option to the `printBinaryishExpression` function, which can be used to conditionally remove spaces around pipe arguments when they are strings or numbers, aligning with the expected behavior described in the bug report."
