    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The issue is that an empty block comment (`/**/`) in JavaScript or TypeScript breaks syntax highlighting. The expected behavior is that the code should be highlighted correctly even with empty block comments.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario images and the problem description indicate that the syntax highlighting fails when an empty block comment is present. This suggests that the current implementation does not handle empty block comments correctly, likely because the comment mode does not account for comments without any content between the delimiters.\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely in the comment handling logic within the JavaScript language definition. Specifically, the `C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` in `src/lib/modes.js` might not be correctly handling empty block comments. The `begin` and `end` patterns for block comments are defined, but there might be a need to adjust the logic to ensure that even empty comments are recognized and processed correctly.\n\n### Generating Patches\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` to handle empty block comments. We will adjust the regular expression to ensure that it can match comments with no content between the delimiters.\n\n```javascript\n### src/lib/modes.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE = COMMENT('/\\\\*', '\\\\*/');\n=======\nexport const C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE = COMMENT('/\\\\*', '\\\\*/', { contains: [] });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **SEARCH**: The original `C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE` is defined using the `COMMENT` function with the start and end delimiters for block comments.\n- **REPLACE**: We add an empty `contains` array to the `COMMENT` function call for `C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE`. This ensures that even if there is no content between the delimiters, the comment is still recognized and processed correctly.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by allowing the syntax highlighter to correctly handle empty block comments, ensuring that the rest of the code is highlighted as expected."
