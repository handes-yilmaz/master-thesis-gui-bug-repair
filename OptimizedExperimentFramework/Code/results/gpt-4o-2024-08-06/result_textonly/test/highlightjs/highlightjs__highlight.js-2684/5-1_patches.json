    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to enhance the syntax highlighting for the Bash language in the provided code snippet. The bug report indicates that certain Bash syntax elements, such as pipes (`|`), stream redirections (`>`, `<`), heredocs (`<<`, `<<<`), and subshell variables (`$(...)`), are not being highlighted as expected.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Analysis\nThe images provided in the bug report show Bash code where specific syntax elements are not highlighted. This includes:\n- Pipes (`|`)\n- Stream redirections (`>`, `<`)\n- Heredocs (`<<`, `<<<`)\n- Subshell variables (`$(...)`)\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is that the current Bash language definition in the `src/languages/bash.js` file does not include rules to highlight these specific syntax elements. The language definition needs to be extended to recognize and highlight these elements.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch Generation\nWe will modify the `src/languages/bash.js` file to include additional rules for highlighting the missing syntax elements.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/bash.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const ARITHMETIC = {\n    begin: /\\$\\(\\(/,\n    end: /\\)\\)/,\n    contains: [\n      { begin: /\\d+#[0-9a-f]+/, className: \"number\" },\n      hljs.NUMBER_MODE,\n      VAR\n    ]\n  };\n  const SH_LIKE_SHELLS = [\n    \"fish\",\n    \"bash\",\n    \"zsh\",\n    \"sh\",\n    \"csh\",\n    \"ksh\",\n    \"tcsh\",\n    \"dash\",\n    \"scsh\",\n  ];\n=======\n  const ARITHMETIC = {\n    begin: /\\$\\(\\(/,\n    end: /\\)\\)/,\n    contains: [\n      { begin: /\\d+#[0-9a-f]+/, className: \"number\" },\n      hljs.NUMBER_MODE,\n      VAR\n    ]\n  };\n  const HEREDOC = {\n    begin: /<<-?\\s*(\\w+)\\n([\\s\\S]*?)\\n\\1/,\n    returnBegin: true,\n    contains: [\n      { begin: /<<-?\\s*\\w+/, className: \"string\" }\n    ]\n  };\n  const REDIRECTION = {\n    className: 'operator',\n    begin: /[<>|]/\n  };\n  const SUBSHELL = {\n    className: 'subst',\n    begin: /\\$\\(/, end: /\\)/,\n    contains: [hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE]\n  };\n  const SH_LIKE_SHELLS = [\n    \"fish\",\n    \"bash\",\n    \"zsh\",\n    \"sh\",\n    \"csh\",\n    \"ksh\",\n    \"tcsh\",\n    \"dash\",\n    \"scsh\",\n  ];\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n- **HEREDOC**: Added a rule to match heredoc syntax, capturing the start and end markers and treating the content as a string.\n- **REDIRECTION**: Added a rule to match and highlight stream redirection operators (`>`, `<`, `|`) as operators.\n- **SUBSHELL**: Added a rule to match subshell syntax (`$(...)`) and highlight it as a substitution.\n\nThese changes should address the issue by ensuring that the specified Bash syntax elements are highlighted correctly."
