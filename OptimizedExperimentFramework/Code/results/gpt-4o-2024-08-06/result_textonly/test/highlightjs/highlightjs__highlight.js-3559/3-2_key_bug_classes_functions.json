        "explanation": "The issue is related to how brackets are being highlighted in Kotlin code. In the 'src/languages/kotlin.js' file, the classes 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE' and 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE2' are responsible for defining the handling of parentheses in Kotlin code. These classes contain regex patterns and logic to identify and process parentheses. Since the problem is specifically about bracket (parentheses) highlighting in Kotlin, these classes are directly related to the issue. The highlighting logic in these classes likely needs to be adjusted to ensure consistent color highlighting of brackets in inheritance contexts.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an issue with bracket highlighting in Kotlin code when viewed in VSCode markdown preview or JSFiddle. Specifically, brackets are highlighted with different colors in the context of class inheritance, which is unexpected. The expected behavior is for brackets to have a consistent color highlighting."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to syntax highlighting in Kotlin, specifically in the context of class inheritance. The compressed bug file 'src/languages/kotlin.js' contains the syntax definitions for Kotlin, including keywords, literals, and other language constructs. The incorrect bracket highlighting is likely due to an issue in this file's configuration of how Kotlin syntax is parsed and highlighted. Therefore, examining and potentially modifying the handling of class and type definitions in this file is necessary to fix the color inconsistency.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a visual issue where brackets in Kotlin class inheritance are highlighted with different colors, breaking the expected uniform syntax highlighting. This occurs in the VSCode markdown preview and can be reproduced using a sample Kotlin code provided in the bug report. The expected behavior is that the brackets should be highlighted with the same color, indicating a consistent style for class inheritance in Kotlin."
