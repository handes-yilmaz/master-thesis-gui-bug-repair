        "explanation": "1. **src/languages/kotlin.js:** This file is likely responsible for defining how Kotlin syntax is highlighted. Since the bug is specifically about the way Kotlin code is displayed, it stands to reason that the logic in this file is related to the issue, particularly how brackets are recognized and styled.\n\n2. **src/lib/html_renderer.js:** This file could be responsible for the actual rendering of the highlighted text in HTML format. If there is any styling inconsistency (such as different bracket coloring), it might be managed or overridden at the HTML rendering stage, generally requiring scrutiny for bugs related to output presentation.\n\nThe problem originates from a mismatch or error in either the syntax parsing for Kotlin or the rendering of the parsed information, or likely both, considering the described issue. Fixing the bug would probably require adjustments in how the syntax rules are defined for Kotlin and how the highlighted sections are outputted in HTML.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided bug report, the issue described is related to the highlighting of brackets with different colors in Kotlin's class inheritance context. The brackets in the sample code snippet provided should ideally have been highlighted with the same color to maintain consistency and readability. However, they are being highlighted differently, causing a visual inconsistency in the markdown preview in VSCode and also reproducible in JSFiddle."

        "explanation": "The files likely related to this bug are primarily those responsible for syntax and syntax highlighting in the repository. \n1. **src/languages/kotlin.js**: This file is likely responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin. As the issue pertains specifically to Kotlin code, this would be the main file to investigate for anomalies in defining how brackets within class inheritance are recognized and highlighted.\n2. **src/lib/regex.js**: This file may contain the regular expressions used across various languages for identifying language constructs such as brackets. A bug here could cause improper tokenization and result in the incorrect coloring of brackets.\n3. **src/lib/highlight.js**: This is potentially the core logic file related to the overall highlighting system. It might handle the application of color schemes based on identified tokens and could be the source of a more systemic bug affecting Kotlin or other languages.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a syntax highlighting issue in IDEs where brackets are improperly colored in Kotlin code, particularly within a class inheritance context. The brackets are expected to be highlighted consistently with the rest of the code but currently appear in a different color, leading to potential confusion and reduced readability."
