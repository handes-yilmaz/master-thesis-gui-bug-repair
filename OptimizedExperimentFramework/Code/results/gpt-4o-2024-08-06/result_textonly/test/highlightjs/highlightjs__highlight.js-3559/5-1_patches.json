    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The issue is related to the incorrect highlighting of brackets in Kotlin code, specifically in the context of class inheritance. The expected behavior is that brackets should be highlighted with the same color.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**:\n   - The problem occurs in the syntax highlighting of Kotlin code, where brackets in class inheritance contexts are highlighted with different colors.\n   - This issue is observed in VSCode markdown preview and reproduced in JSFiddle.\n\n2. **Root Cause**:\n   - The root cause of the issue is likely related to the way the syntax highlighting rules are defined for Kotlin in the `src/languages/kotlin.js` file.\n   - Specifically, the rules for highlighting class definitions and inheritance might not be correctly handling the brackets, leading to inconsistent coloring.\n\n3. **Bug Location**:\n   - The relevant section of the code is in the `src/languages/kotlin.js` file, particularly in the part where class definitions and inheritance are handled.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the syntax highlighting rules for Kotlin to ensure that brackets in class inheritance contexts are highlighted consistently. Here's the patch to address the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/kotlin.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n{\n  className: 'type',\n  begin: /[,:]\\s*/,\n  end: /[<\\(,]|$/,\n  excludeBegin: true,\n  returnEnd: true\n},\n=======\n{\n  className: 'type',\n  begin: /[,:]\\s*/,\n  end: /[<\\(,]|$/,\n  excludeBegin: true,\n  returnEnd: true,\n  contains: [\n    {\n      className: 'punctuation',\n      begin: /[<>()]/,\n      relevance: 0\n    }\n  ]\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- **Search Block**: The original code defines a rule for highlighting types in class definitions and inheritance contexts. However, it does not explicitly handle the punctuation (brackets) within these contexts.\n- **Replace Block**: The modified code adds a `contains` array to the rule, which includes a new rule for highlighting punctuation (brackets) with a consistent class name (`punctuation`). This ensures that brackets are highlighted consistently, addressing the issue described in the bug report.\n\nBy applying this patch, the syntax highlighting for Kotlin code should correctly highlight brackets in class inheritance contexts with the same color, as expected."
