        "explanation": "The files 'src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js' and 'src/languages/javascript.js' are likely responsible for defining the language syntax rules for JavaScript and its variants, including ES6. These files would be directly responsible for ensuring that the features of ES6, such as class member functions, are appropriately recognized and highlighted.\n\nAdditionally, 'src/lib/html_renderer.js' may be involved if it is responsible for rendering the highlighted syntax as HTML, which is then inserted into the DOM in the React component. If there is a problem in rendering the highlighted syntax, it might be within this file.\n\nThese files collectively oversee the parsing of ES6 syntax and the highlighting process, making them the most likely candidates for bugs affecting the highlighting of member functions within ES6 classes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is that member functions in ES6 classes are not being highlighted when using the highlight.js library in conjunction with the marked library in a React application. The bug report includes a code snippet that demonstrates how highlight.js is being used, and it describes that the functions within the rendered code are not highlighted as expected."

        "explanation": "1. **src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js**: This file is likely responsible for the syntax highlighting rules for ECMAScript, which includes JavaScript. If member functions in ES6 classes are not highlighted, it could be due to missing or incorrect rules in this file.\n\n2. **src/languages/javascript.js**: Similarly to the ecmascript.js file, this file probably contains the specific JavaScript language syntax definitions. Any issues with not highlighting class member functions could stem from incorrect or incomplete patterns defined here.\n\n3. **src/lib/html_renderer.js**: This file may handle the rendering of highlighted code to HTML. If functions are not being highlighted, it may be an issue with how these elements are being converted to HTML, potentially missing certain CSS classes or spans.\n\n4. **src/highlight.js**: This is the main file for highlight.js. It likely coordinates the loading of language definitions and the actual highlighting process. Improper function highlighting might result from configurations or logic issues within this core mechanism. The problem may require checks to see if the language definitions are being correctly utilized by this central script.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when using highlight.js to highlight code within a React component. Specifically, member functions in an ES6 class are not being highlighted when their source code is rendered as HTML using the marked library combined with highlight.js. This results in the syntax not being visually distinguished in the rendered output, as demonstrated in the bug report image where the functions appear as plain text rather than being highlighted."
