    "1/1": "To address the issue of member functions not being highlighted in ES6 classes, we need to ensure that the JavaScript language definition in the highlight.js library correctly identifies and highlights member functions within ES6 classes. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to locate the bug and generate the necessary patches.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**:\n   - The bug report indicates that member functions within ES6 classes are not being highlighted when using highlight.js in a React application.\n   - The provided image shows that while other parts of the code are highlighted, member functions are not.\n\n2. **Root Cause**:\n   - The root cause is likely that the JavaScript language definition in highlight.js does not correctly identify member functions within ES6 classes for highlighting.\n\n3. **Bug Location**:\n   - The relevant code for defining JavaScript syntax highlighting is in `src/languages/javascript.js`.\n   - We need to ensure that the language definition includes rules for identifying and highlighting member functions within ES6 classes.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nLet's generate the necessary patches to fix the issue by updating the JavaScript language definition to include member functions in ES6 classes.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/javascript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      { // ES6 class\n        className: 'class',\n        beginKeywords: 'class',\n        end: /[{;=]/,\n        excludeEnd: true,\n        illegal: /[:\"\\[\\]]/,\n        contains: [\n          { beginKeywords: 'extends' },\n          hljs.UNDERSCORE_TITLE_MODE\n        ]\n      },\n=======\n      { // ES6 class\n        className: 'class',\n        beginKeywords: 'class',\n        end: /[{;=]/,\n        excludeEnd: true,\n        illegal: /[:\"\\[\\]]/,\n        contains: [\n          { beginKeywords: 'extends' },\n          hljs.UNDERSCORE_TITLE_MODE,\n          {\n            begin: /[A-Za-z$_][0-9A-Za-z$_]*(?=\\()/, // member function\n            className: 'title'\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Search Block**: We locate the existing definition for ES6 classes in the JavaScript language definition.\n- **Replace Block**: We add a new rule within the `contains` array to identify member functions. The regular expression `/[A-Za-z$_][0-9A-Za-z$_]*(?=\\()/` is used to match function names followed by parentheses, which is typical for member functions.\n- **ClassName**: We assign the class name `'title'` to these matches to ensure they are highlighted as function names.\n\nThis patch should ensure that member functions within ES6 classes are correctly highlighted when using highlight.js."
