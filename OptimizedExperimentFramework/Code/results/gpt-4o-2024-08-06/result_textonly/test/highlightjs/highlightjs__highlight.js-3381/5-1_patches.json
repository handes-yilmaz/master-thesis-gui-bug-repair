    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The problem is that part of an identifier in Python code is being incorrectly highlighted as a keyword. Specifically, the identifier `_undef` is being partially highlighted as the keyword `def`.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that the issue occurs when using the syntax highlighter for Python code. The identifier `_undef` is being split, and the `def` part is being highlighted as a keyword. This suggests that the regular expression or logic used to identify keywords in the syntax highlighter is incorrectly matching parts of identifiers.\n\n### Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to the regular expression or logic used to match keywords in the Python syntax highlighter. The regular expression might be too permissive, allowing it to match parts of identifiers that contain keyword substrings.\n\n### Bug Localization\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `src/languages/python.js` file. The issue is likely related to the `KEYWORDS` object or the logic that applies these keywords to the code being highlighted. The `$pattern` property in the `KEYWORDS` object is used to match keywords, and it might be incorrectly matching parts of identifiers.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the regular expression used to match keywords does not match parts of identifiers. We can adjust the `$pattern` to ensure it only matches whole words.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const KEYWORDS = {\n    $pattern: /[A-Za-z]\\w+|__\\w+__/,\n    keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,\n    built_in: BUILT_INS,\n    literal: LITERALS,\n    type: TYPES\n  };\n=======\n  const KEYWORDS = {\n    $pattern: /\\b[A-Za-z]\\w*\\b|__\\w+__/,\n    keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,\n    built_in: BUILT_INS,\n    literal: LITERALS,\n    type: TYPES\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `$pattern` regular expression is modified to use `\\b` (word boundary) at the beginning and end of the pattern. This ensures that only whole words are matched, preventing partial matches within identifiers.\n- The `\\b` ensures that the match starts and ends at a word boundary, which is crucial for preventing partial matches like `_undef` being split into `_un` and `def`.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that only complete keywords are highlighted, not parts of identifiers that contain keyword substrings."
