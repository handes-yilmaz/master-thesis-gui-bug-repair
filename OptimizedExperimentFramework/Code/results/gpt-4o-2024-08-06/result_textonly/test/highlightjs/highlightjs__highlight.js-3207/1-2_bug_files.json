        "explanation": "The files most likely related to the bug are `src/languages/elixir.js` and `src/lib/regex.js` based on the repository structure and the described bug. The file `src/languages/elixir.js` is responsible for the language definition for Elixir syntax highlighting in the project. This file would need adjustments to correctly interpret the `&function_name/arity` syntax.\n\nThe `src/lib/regex.js` file might also be pertinent because this file might contain the regular expressions used in syntax parsing and highlighting logic, which could be insufficient for handling Elixir's specific function capture syntax correctly. Adjustments or additional regex handling might be needed in this file to resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect code highlighting in Elixir snippets when using the shorthand function capture syntax `&function_name/arity`. The issue arises because the `/` in the syntax may be misinterpreted by the highlighter as a division operator or something else, causing incorrect parsing and coloring of the code. An image shows the expected highlighting for comparison where `&letter?/1` should be highlighted correctly."

        "explanation": "The file `src/languages/elixir.js` is directly related to this bug because it contains the logic for syntax highlighting specific to the Elixir programming language. Since the issue involves the incorrect highlighting of Elixir-specific syntax, modifications in this file are necessary to adjust how the highlighter interprets the `/` character in the context of function captures. This would likely involve altering regular expression patterns or parsing logic specific to Elixir syntax within this file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the incorrect syntax highlighting in Elixir code when using the function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`). The highlighter confuses the `/` character, treating it as a delimiter and causing incorrect colorization of the subsequent code until another `/` is encountered. This problem occurs when the `highlight` function is used, and the expected behavior is for the code to maintain correct syntax colors, with function captures remaining white."
