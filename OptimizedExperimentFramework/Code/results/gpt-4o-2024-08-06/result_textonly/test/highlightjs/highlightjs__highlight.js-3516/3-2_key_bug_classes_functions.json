        "explanation": "The issue lies within the syntax highlighting rules for CSS in the 'highlight' library. The file 'src/languages/css.js' contains the logic for CSS highlighting, including handling strings and URLs. The default function in this file defines the rules for recognizing and highlighting CSS syntax elements, including strings and URLs. The problem arises because the logic for URL recognition incorrectly handles parentheses, failing to correctly match strings that contain them. This causes incorrect highlighting as noted in the bug report. Therefore, adjustments need to be made to the string and URL recognition logic within this function to correctly handle parentheses in CSS strings.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting in CSS where a string within parentheses (e.g., URLs in CSS) is not correctly recognized. When a closing parenthesis ')' appears in the string, it should not take precedence over single or double quotes for string matching. This issue causes URLs with parentheses in CSS to not be highlighted correctly."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the incorrect handling of strings containing parentheses in CSS code. In the compressed bug files, the `default function` in `src/languages/css.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting behavior for CSS, including how strings are parsed and highlighted. The function defines various modes and patterns that determine how different CSS constructs are recognized, including strings. The issue arises from the handling logic within this function, particularly in the segment that deals with the parsing of URLs and strings, where the presence of ')' within a string disrupts proper string recognition. Hence, the `default function` is the key element that needs to be addressed to fix this highlighting issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting in CSS code where a string within parentheses is not highlighted correctly. Specifically, when a closing parenthesis ')' appears within a string, it takes precedence over the string delimiters such as single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). This results in incorrect parsing of the string when using the `highlight` function of the library."
