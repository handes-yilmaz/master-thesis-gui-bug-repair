    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The issue is related to the incorrect highlighting of strings within parentheses in CSS, specifically when using the `highlight` library.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe bug report indicates that when a closing parenthesis `)` appears within a string in CSS, it is incorrectly prioritized over the string delimiters `'` or `\"`. This results in incorrect syntax highlighting, as shown in the provided image. The problem occurs in the context of CSS `url()` functions, where the string should be highlighted correctly even if it contains parentheses.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause of the issue lies in the way the `highlight` library processes and highlights CSS strings, particularly within the `url()` function. The current implementation does not correctly handle strings that contain parentheses, leading to premature termination of the string highlighting.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe relevant code snippet is located in the `src/languages/css.js` file. The issue is within the section that handles attribute values, specifically the handling of `url()` and `data-uri` functions. The current implementation uses a regular expression to match the start of a string but does not account for nested parentheses within the string.\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust the regular expression and logic to ensure that strings within `url()` functions are correctly highlighted, even if they contain parentheses.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/css.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n          {\n            begin: /(url|data-uri)\\(/,\n            end: /\\)/,\n            relevance: 0, // from keywords\n            keywords: { built_in: \"url data-uri\" },\n            contains: [\n              {\n                className: \"string\",\n                // any character other than `)` as in `url()` will be the start\n                // of a string, which ends with `)` (from the parent mode)\n                begin: /[^)]/,\n                endsWithParent: true,\n                excludeEnd: true\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n=======\n          {\n            begin: /(url|data-uri)\\(/,\n            end: /\\)/,\n            relevance: 0, // from keywords\n            keywords: { built_in: \"url data-uri\" },\n            contains: [\n              {\n                className: \"string\",\n                // match any character including nested parentheses\n                begin: /[^()]+/,\n                endsWithParent: true,\n                excludeEnd: true\n              }\n            ]\n          },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original code attempts to match any character other than `)` as the start of a string within `url()` functions. This approach fails when the string contains nested parentheses.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The updated code uses a more flexible regular expression `/[^()]+/` to match any character, including nested parentheses, within the string. This ensures that the entire string is correctly highlighted, even if it contains parentheses.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by correctly highlighting strings within `url()` functions in CSS, regardless of the presence of parentheses."
