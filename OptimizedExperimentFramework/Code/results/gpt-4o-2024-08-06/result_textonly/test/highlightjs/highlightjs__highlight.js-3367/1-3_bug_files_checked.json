        "explanation": "The file `src/languages/python.js` is likely responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Python language in the library. Since the issue relates to how Python code is being parsed and highlighted, any fixes or modifications to improve the detection of keywords following numbers should be implemented in this file. The issue likely originates from this language-specific file because the highlighting logic, including keywords recognition and spaces or token separation logic, would reside here.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the syntax highlighting feature of a code editor library when dealing with Python code. Specifically, keywords directly following numbers are not being properly detected and highlighted as separate tokens. For example, in the code snippet `print(1if 0==0else\"b\")`, the `1` and `if` are incorrectly highlighted as one token. The expected behavior is that `1` and `if` are highlighted as separate tokens, and `print` should be recognized and highlighted as a built-in keyword."

        "explanation": "The file `python.js` in the `src/languages/` directory is likely responsible for defining or handling the syntax highlighting rules for Python. Since the issue specifically pertains to how Python code is being parsed and highlighted (particularly the separation between numbers and keywords), modifications in this file would be required to address the problem. It is responsible for the language-specific logic for Python and thus relevant for fixing the bug to ensure numbers and keywords are distinguished as expected in syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to syntax highlighting not correctly separating numbers and keywords in Python code. In the given code snippet, `1if` should be separated into `1` (a number) and `if` (a keyword), but the current system fails to do so. This is evident from comparing the 'Actual output' and 'Expected output' images, where the former displays them connected, while the latter correctly separates and highlights them."
