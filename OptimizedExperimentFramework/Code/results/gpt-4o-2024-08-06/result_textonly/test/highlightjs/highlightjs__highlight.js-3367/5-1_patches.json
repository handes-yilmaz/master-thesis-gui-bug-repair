    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the syntax highlighting correctly separates numbers from keywords in Python code. The problem arises because the current implementation does not handle cases where a keyword directly follows a number without any space, such as `1if`.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that the syntax highlighting does not correctly separate numbers from keywords when they are directly adjacent. The expected behavior is that the number and the keyword should be highlighted separately, as shown in the expected output image. The actual output image shows that the number and the keyword are not separated, leading to incorrect highlighting.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely in the regular expression patterns used to identify numbers and keywords in the `src/languages/python.js` file. The current patterns do not account for the possibility of a keyword immediately following a number without any intervening space.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `NUMBER` and `KEYWORDS` patterns within the `src/languages/python.js` file. We need to adjust the regular expression for numbers to ensure that it does not consume characters that could be part of a keyword.\n\n### Patch\nWe will modify the `NUMBER` pattern to ensure it does not consume characters that could be part of a keyword. Specifically, we will add a negative lookahead to prevent the number pattern from matching characters that could start a keyword.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b([1-9](_?[0-9])*|0+(_?0)*)[lLjJ]?\\\\b'\n      },\n=======\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b([1-9](_?[0-9])*|0+(_?0)*)[lLjJ]?(?!\\\\w)\\\\b'\n      },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change adds a `(?!\\\\w)` negative lookahead to the number pattern, ensuring that it does not match if a word character (which could be the start of a keyword) follows the number. This should correctly separate numbers from keywords in the syntax highlighting."
