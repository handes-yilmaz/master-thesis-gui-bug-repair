    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, let's break down the problem and identify the necessary changes:\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause Analysis\n\n**Bug Scenario:**\nThe issue is with the Dart language highlighting in a code editor. When an empty block comment (`/**/`) is used, it breaks the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code. The expected behavior is that the code should be highlighted correctly even if there are empty block comments.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to how the Dart language definition in the syntax highlighter handles comments. Specifically, the handling of block comments (`/* ... */`) might not account for empty comments, causing the highlighter to fail or behave unexpectedly.\n\n### Bug Localization and Fix\n\n**Bug Localization:**\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `src/languages/dart.js` file. The issue is likely within the comment handling section of the Dart language definition.\n\n**Fix:**\nWe need to ensure that the highlighter correctly processes empty block comments. This can be done by modifying the comment handling logic to account for empty block comments.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/dart.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,\n=======\n      hljs.COMMENT(\n        '/\\\\*',\n        '\\\\*/',\n        {\n          contains: [],\n          relevance: 0\n        }\n      ),\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- **SEARCH Block:** The original code uses `hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE`, which is a generic mode for C-style block comments. This mode might not handle empty block comments correctly.\n  \n- **REPLACE Block:** We replace it with a custom comment mode that explicitly defines the start (`/*`) and end (`*/`) of block comments. The `contains` array is empty, indicating that no nested elements are expected within the comment, which allows for empty comments. The `relevance` is set to 0 to ensure it doesn't affect the overall relevance scoring of the syntax highlighting.\n\nThis patch should fix the issue by allowing the highlighter to correctly process empty block comments without breaking the syntax highlighting for the rest of the code."
