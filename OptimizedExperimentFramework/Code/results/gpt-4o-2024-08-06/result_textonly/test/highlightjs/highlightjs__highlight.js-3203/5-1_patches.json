    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the PowerShell language definition correctly highlights both single and double hyphen flags. The current implementation seems to only recognize single hyphen flags, which is why `--flag` is not being highlighted correctly.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that in PowerShell, flags with double hyphens (e.g., `--flag`) are not being highlighted correctly, whereas single hyphen flags (e.g., `-flag`) are highlighted as expected. The expected behavior is that both single and double hyphen flags should be highlighted.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely in the regular expression used to match flags in the PowerShell language definition. The current regex might only be accounting for single hyphen flags, thus missing out on double hyphen flags.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe relevant section of the code is likely in the `PS_ARGUMENTS` or `CMDLETS` section where flags are defined. We need to modify the regex to account for both single and double hyphen flags.\n\n### Patch\nWe will update the regex in the `PS_ARGUMENTS` section to include double hyphen flags.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/powershell.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const PS_ARGUMENTS = {\n    variants: [\n      // PS literals are pretty verbose so it's a good idea to accent them a bit.\n      {\n        className: 'operator',\n        begin: '('.concat(COMPARISON_OPERATORS, ')\\\\b')\n      },\n      {\n        className: 'literal',\n        begin: /(-)[\\w\\d]+/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n=======\n  const PS_ARGUMENTS = {\n    variants: [\n      // PS literals are pretty verbose so it's a good idea to accent them a bit.\n      {\n        className: 'operator',\n        begin: '('.concat(COMPARISON_OPERATORS, ')\\\\b')\n      },\n      {\n        className: 'literal',\n        begin: /(--?)[\\w\\d]+/,  // Updated regex to include double hyphen\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch updates the regex to match both single and double hyphen flags, ensuring that `--flag` is highlighted correctly in PowerShell scripts."
