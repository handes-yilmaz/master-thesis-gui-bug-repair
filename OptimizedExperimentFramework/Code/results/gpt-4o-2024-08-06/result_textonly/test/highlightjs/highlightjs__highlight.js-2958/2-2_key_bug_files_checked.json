        "explanation": "The file 'src/languages/xml.js' is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for XML. The issue described in the bug report is related to the incorrect highlighting of XML tags with single-letter namespace prefixes. The relevant part of the code in this file is the regular expression used to match tag names, which currently does not account for single-letter prefixes correctly. Adjusting the regular expression to handle single-letter prefixes will likely resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves XML code highlighting where a single-letter namespace prefix is not being highlighted correctly since version 10.4.0. The issue is demonstrated with XML tags having different namespace prefixes, and the tag with a single-letter prefix ('a:FAIL') is not highlighted as expected. The expected behavior is for all tags, including those with single-letter prefixes, to be highlighted correctly."
