    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the number `0` and numbers starting with `0` are correctly highlighted as numbers in Elixir code. The current implementation does not recognize `0` or numbers like `0123` and `0.3` as valid numbers for highlighting purposes.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is in the regular expression used to identify numbers in the Elixir language definition. The current regex pattern for numbers does not account for the standalone `0` or numbers starting with `0` (like `0123` or `0.3`). The regex pattern needs to be updated to include these cases.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `NUMBER` object within the `src/languages/elixir.js` file. The `begin` property of the `NUMBER` object contains the regex pattern that needs to be modified.\n\n### Patch\nWe will modify the regex pattern in the `NUMBER` object to correctly identify `0`, numbers starting with `0`, and floating-point numbers starting with `0`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/elixir.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    begin: '(\\\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',\n    relevance: 0\n  };\n=======\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    begin: '(\\\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\\\b(0|[1-9][0-9_]*)(\\\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',\n    relevance: 0\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The regex pattern is updated to include `0` as a valid number by changing `[1-9][0-9_]*` to `(0|[1-9][0-9_]*)`. This allows the pattern to match a standalone `0` as well as numbers starting with `0`.\n- This change ensures that `0`, `0123`, and `0.3` are all recognized and highlighted as numbers, addressing the issue described in the bug report."
