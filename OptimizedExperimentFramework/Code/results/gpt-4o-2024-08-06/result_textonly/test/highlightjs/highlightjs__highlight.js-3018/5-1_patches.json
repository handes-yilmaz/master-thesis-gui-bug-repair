    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `BigInt` type, along with `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`, are recognized and highlighted correctly in the `ecmascript` and `javascript` languages. However, since no specific bug code snippets are provided in the \"* Bug Code Snippets\" section, I cannot generate specific patches for the code.\n\nHere is a general approach to fix the issue:\n\n1. **Identify the Syntax Highlighting Module**: Locate the module or file responsible for syntax highlighting in the codebase. This could be a part of a larger library or a custom implementation.\n\n2. **Add BigInt and Related Types**: Update the syntax highlighting rules to include `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` as recognized types. This typically involves adding these keywords to a list of recognized types or updating a regular expression pattern.\n\n3. **Test the Changes**: After making the changes, test the syntax highlighting with sample code to ensure that `BigInt` and related types are highlighted correctly.\n\nIf you can provide the relevant code snippets or files responsible for syntax highlighting, I can help generate specific patches to address the issue."
