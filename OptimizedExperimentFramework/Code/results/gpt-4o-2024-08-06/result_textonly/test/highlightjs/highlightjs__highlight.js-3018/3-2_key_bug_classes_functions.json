        "explanation": "The bug is related to the incomplete list of recognized types within the ECMAScript and JavaScript language definition files. In the compressed bug files, `BigInt` and related types such as `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are missing from the `TYPES` array in the ecmascript.js file. This array defines the list of types that should be highlighted. The absence of these types is why they are not being recognized or highlighted in the user's code. Therefore, the relevant code section is the `TYPES` array in the `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` file. Adding the missing types to this array would solve the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the `BigInt` type not being highlighted or recognized as a type in the ECMAScript and JavaScript language definitions, similar to how `Number` is highlighted. The issue also extends to `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`. The user provided images show that the `BigInt` type is not being syntax highlighted as expected, and additional types are also missing from the list of recognized types."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting definitions found in the `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` file. In this file, the `TYPES` array lists various JavaScript types that are recognized for syntax highlighting. The issue arises because `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` are missing from this list. To fix this bug, these types should be added to the `TYPES` array within the `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` file so that they are correctly recognized and highlighted as JavaScript types.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where the `BigInt` type in JavaScript is not highlighted the same way as other types like `Number`. This issue is observed in the syntax highlighting of ECMAScript and JavaScript code within an editor or a tool that uses this syntax definition. The sample code provided to reproduce the issue is `let bi = BigInt('1');` and the expected behavior is that `BigInt` should be recognized and highlighted as a type. Additionally, `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are also mentioned as missing types in the highlighting."
