        "explanation": "The files that are likely related to the bug are located in the `src/languages/` directory. The `ecmascript.js` file is particularly relevant because the issue is with the ECMAScript language (JavaScript), and this file seems to pertain directly to its syntax highlighting. Furthermore, since JavaScript typically relies on ECMAScript standards, the `javascript.js` file is also likely involved because it handles the broader implementation of JavaScript-specific syntax highlighting. These files will need to be updated to include logic for recognizing and highlighting `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array`, similar to how numbers are currently handled.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is that the `BigInt` type in JavaScript is not being recognized or highlighted in the same way other types like `Number` are. This is evident from the bug report description and the provided visual showing the missing syntax highlighting for `BigInt`. Additionally, the report mentions that `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are also not recognized."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the ECMAScript and JavaScript language processing part of the software. Given the repository structure, the files `src/languages/ecmascript.js` and `src/languages/javascript.js` are the most likely to contain the logic for parsing or recognizing ECMAScript and JavaScript syntax. Since the bug involves the incorrect handling of the `BigInt` type, these files need to be modified to include `BigInt` and its associated types (`BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`) as recognized types. This will ensure they are highlighted or treated correctly as expected in the language specification.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is that in the ECMAScript or JavaScript language handling within the codebase, the `BigInt` type is not being recognized or highlighted as a proper type the same way that `Number` is. This is evident when users write code using `BigInt`, for example, `let bi = BigInt('1');`, where `BigInt` should be highlighted or treated as a known type but is currently not being marked as such. The expected behavior is to have `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` highlighted or recognized, similar to how `Number` or arrays are treated. This discrepancy is illustrated in the bug report with images showing how `BigInt` currently appears versus how it should appear."
