        "explanation": "The class in 'src/languages/sql.js' defines the SQL language grammar for highlight.js, including string handling and keyword definitions. The bug is related to how string escape sequences are processed, which is directly managed within this class. The functions in 'src/highlight.js' are responsible for the core functionality of highlighting, including processing the language grammar to apply syntax highlighting to code blocks. They are directly involved in the highlighting process and would need to be examined and potentially modified to fix the issue with escape sequences causing incorrect syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an issue with the SQL language highlighting in a code editor that uses highlight.js. Specifically, the highlighting breaks when encountering string escape sequences at the end of dynamic SQL statements. The problem is evident in SQL or TSQL code blocks where strings contain escape sequences, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting."

        "explanation": "The class in 'src/languages/sql.js' is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for SQL code in highlight.js. Since the problem occurs when highlighting SQL code, this class is directly related to the bug. It contains definitions and rules for handling SQL keywords, strings, and comments, including the handling of escape sequences in strings, which is where the issue arises.\n\nThe functions 'highlight' and 'private highlight' in 'src/highlight.js' are core functions for applying syntax highlighting. These functions manage the overall process of highlighting code, including calling the appropriate language definitions and handling special cases like escape sequences. Therefore, they are relevant to the bug as they need to correctly parse and apply the SQL highlighting rules defined in 'src/languages/sql.js'. The problem with escape sequences likely requires changes in how these functions process string literals in SQL.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the highlight.js library breaking on quote escape sequences when highlighting SQL code. The issue arises when there is a string escape sequence at the end of a dynamic SQL statement, causing the highlighting to fail or behave incorrectly. This issue is observed when using the 'sql' or 'tsql' language options in highlight.js, as evidenced by a screenshot provided by the user."
