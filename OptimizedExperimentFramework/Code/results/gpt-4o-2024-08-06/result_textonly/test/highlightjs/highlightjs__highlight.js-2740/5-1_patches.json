    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the SQL language definition in the `src/languages/sql.js` file. The problem arises from the handling of string escape sequences, particularly when dealing with single quotes in SQL strings. The current implementation does not correctly handle escaped single quotes, which leads to incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is the incorrect handling of escape sequences within SQL strings. The current implementation in `src/languages/sql.js` does not properly account for escaped single quotes (`''`), which are used in SQL to represent a single quote character within a string. This results in the syntax highlighter breaking when it encounters such sequences.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `src/languages/sql.js` file, specifically in the section where string patterns are defined. The current pattern for single-quoted strings does not correctly handle escaped single quotes.\n\n### Patch\nTo fix the issue, we need to update the string pattern to correctly handle escaped single quotes. We will modify the pattern to ensure that sequences of two single quotes are treated as a single quote character within the string.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/sql.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '\\'', end: '\\'',\n            contains: [{begin: '\\'\\''}]\n          },\n=======\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '\\'',\n            end: '\\'',\n            contains: [{begin: '\\'\\''}],\n            relevance: 0\n          },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `begin` and `end` properties define the start and end of a string, respectively. The `contains` property is used to specify patterns that can appear within the string. In this case, it specifies that two consecutive single quotes (`''`) should be treated as a single quote character within the string.\n- The `relevance: 0` is added to ensure that the presence of escaped quotes does not affect the relevance score of the match, which is important for accurate language detection and highlighting.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by correctly handling escaped single quotes in SQL strings, ensuring proper syntax highlighting."
