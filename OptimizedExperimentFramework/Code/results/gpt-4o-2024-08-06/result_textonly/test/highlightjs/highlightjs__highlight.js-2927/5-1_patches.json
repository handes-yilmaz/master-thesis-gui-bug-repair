    "1/1": "To address the issue of incorrect highlighting for the `LL` suffix in C/C++ integer literals, we need to modify the regular expression responsible for recognizing C/C++ numbers in the code. The bug report indicates that only the first `L` is highlighted, which suggests that the regular expression does not account for the `LL` suffix properly.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves the incorrect syntax highlighting of integer literals with the `LL` suffix in C/C++ code. The expected behavior is that both `L`s in the `LL` suffix should be highlighted, but currently, only the first `L` is highlighted. This issue is likely due to the regular expression used to match C/C++ numbers not being comprehensive enough to include the `LL` suffix.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe relevant code snippet is found in the `src/lib/modes.js` file, where the `C_NUMBER_RE` regular expression is defined. This regular expression is responsible for matching C/C++ numbers, and it needs to be updated to correctly handle the `LL` suffix.\n\n### Patch Generation\nWe will update the `C_NUMBER_RE` regular expression to include the `LL` suffix. The current regular expression does not account for this suffix, which is why the highlighting is incorrect.\n\n```javascript\n### src/lib/modes.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const C_NUMBER_RE = '(-?)(\\\\b0[xX][a-fA-F0-9]+|(\\\\b\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)([eE][-+]?\\\\d+)?)';\n=======\nexport const C_NUMBER_RE = '(-?)(\\\\b0[xX][a-fA-F0-9]+|(\\\\b\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d*)?|\\\\.\\\\d+)([eE][-+]?\\\\d+)?)([uU]?[lL]{0,2})';\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The original `C_NUMBER_RE` regular expression matches hexadecimal numbers, decimal numbers, and floating-point numbers but does not account for the `LL` suffix.\n- The updated regular expression now includes `([uU]?[lL]{0,2})` at the end, which matches optional `U` or `u` for unsigned numbers and up to two `L`s or `l`s for long and long long suffixes. This change ensures that both `L`s in the `LL` suffix are correctly highlighted."
