    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to handle the case where a properties file ends with an escaped backslash (`\\\\`). The current implementation does not correctly interpret this scenario, leading to incorrect parsing of the properties file.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that properties files support multi-line values using a backslash (`\\`) to escape the newline. However, when the last character is an escaped backslash (`\\\\`), it is not handled correctly. This is particularly problematic for Windows paths, which often end with a backslash.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is that the current implementation does not account for the scenario where a line ends with an escaped backslash. The regular expression used to parse the value does not correctly handle this case, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `DELIM_AND_VALUE` object within the `src/languages/properties.js` file. The `end` property of the `starts` object within `DELIM_AND_VALUE` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle lines ending with an escaped backslash.\n\n### Patch\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `end` property of the `starts` object within `DELIM_AND_VALUE` to correctly handle lines ending with an escaped backslash. We will update the regular expression to account for this scenario.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/properties.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            end: /$/,\n=======\n            end: /(?<!\\\\)$/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the regular expression to use a negative lookbehind assertion `(?<!\\\\)`, which ensures that the end of the line is not preceded by an escaped backslash. This change will correctly handle the case where a line ends with an escaped backslash, resolving the issue described in the bug report."
