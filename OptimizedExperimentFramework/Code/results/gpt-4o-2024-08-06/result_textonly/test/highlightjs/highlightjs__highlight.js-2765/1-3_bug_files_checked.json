        "explanation": "The files `src/languages/handlebars.js` and `src/languages/htmlbars.js` are directly related to the bug because these are the files that define the syntax highlighting rules for Handlebars and potentially Glimmer templates. Since the issue is with how Handlebars syntax is being interpreted and highlighted, these would be the primary files to examine and modify to ensure correct rendering of 'if' blocks and other Handlebars/Glimmer template elements. Adjustments in these files would directly affect how the syntax is recognized and presented, impacting the distinct and consistent highlighting that is expected but currently failing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue described in the bug report concerns incorrect syntax highlighting of Handlebars block 'if' statements when using the `highlight` tool. Specifically, the problem arises with Glimmer templates where values and keywords are not being highlighted distinctly and consistently. The report includes an example where a block 'if' statement does not render as expected, compared to how it visually renders on GitHub, which provides a slightly better representation."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is directly related to the syntax highlighting of Handlebars templates, which suggests problems in how these templates are being processed and highlighted. Given the repository structure, the most relevant files for the Handlebars syntax would be `handlebars.js` and possibly `htmlbars.js` in the `src/languages/` directory. These files are likely responsible for defining how Handlebars code is tokenized and styled, and therefore are crucial for fixing the highlighting issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves syntax highlighting issues in Handlebars (HBS) templates, particularly with block `if` statements in Glimmer templates. In the provided example, values and keywords within the Handlebars template are not being highlighted correctly or consistently when rendered on a blog compared to GitHub highlighting."
