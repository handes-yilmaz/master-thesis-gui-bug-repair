    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the syntax highlighting for Handlebars, specifically for block `if` and `else` statements. The problem is that the current syntax highlighting does not properly distinguish between values and keywords, leading to inconsistent highlighting.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image shows a code snippet from a blog where the Handlebars block `if` and `else` statements are not highlighted correctly. The expected behavior is that keywords like `if`, `else`, and `else if` should be highlighted distinctly from the values or variables they are associated with. The current implementation seems to treat them all the same, leading to a lack of visual distinction.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe issue likely stems from the way keywords and expressions are defined and highlighted in the `handlebars.js` file. Specifically, the handling of `else` and `else if` within the Handlebars syntax needs to be improved to ensure they are recognized as distinct keywords.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the way `else` and `else if` are handled in the `handlebars.js` file. We will add a specific handling for `else if` and ensure that `else` is treated as a keyword.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/handlebars.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      {\n        className: 'template-tag',\n        begin: /\\\\{\\\\{(?=else\\\\}\\\\})/,\n        end: /\\\\}\\\\}/,\n        keywords: 'else'\n      },\n=======\n      {\n        className: 'template-tag',\n        begin: /\\\\{\\\\{(?=else(\\\\s+if)?\\\\}\\\\})/,\n        end: /\\\\}\\\\}/,\n        keywords: 'else else if'\n      },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original code only handles `else` as a keyword, using a regex pattern that matches `{{else}}`.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The updated code modifies the regex pattern to also match `{{else if}}` by including an optional `if` after `else`. The `keywords` property is updated to include both `else` and `else if`, ensuring they are highlighted as distinct keywords.\n\nThis change should improve the syntax highlighting for Handlebars templates, making the distinction between keywords and values more apparent and consistent."
