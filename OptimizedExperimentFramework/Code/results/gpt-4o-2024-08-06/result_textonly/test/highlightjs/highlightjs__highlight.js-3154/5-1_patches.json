    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the handling of Ruby heredocs without interpolation in the syntax highlighting logic. The problem is that these heredocs are not being highlighted correctly, as shown in the provided screenshot. The root cause is likely related to the regex pattern used to detect heredocs in the `src/languages/ruby.js` file.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that Ruby heredocs without interpolation (i.e., those using single quotes) are not being highlighted correctly. The expected behavior is for the entire heredoc to be highlighted as a string, with the ending detected properly. The issue arises because the current regex pattern does not account for heredocs that use single quotes, which prevent interpolation.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe relevant code snippet in `src/languages/ruby.js` is the regex pattern used to detect heredocs. The current pattern is:\n```javascript\n{\n  begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?(\\\\w+)\\\\n(?:[^\\\\n]*\\\\n)*?\\\\s*\\\\1\\\\b/,\n  returnBegin: true,\n  contains: [\n    {\n      begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?/\n    },\n    hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({\n      begin: /(\\\\w+)/,\n      end: /(\\\\w+)/,\n      contains: [\n        hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n        SUBST\n      ]\n    })\n  ]\n}\n```\nThis pattern is intended to match heredocs but does not correctly handle the case where single quotes are used to prevent interpolation.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the regex pattern to correctly handle heredocs without interpolation. Specifically, we need to ensure that the pattern can match the ending of a heredoc that starts with `<<-'MESSAGE'`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/ruby.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      { // heredocs\n        begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?(\\\\w+)\\\\n(?:[^\\\\n]*\\\\n)*?\\\\s*\\\\1\\\\b/,\n        returnBegin: true,\n        contains: [\n          {\n            begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?/\n          },\n          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({\n            begin: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            end: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            contains: [\n              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n              SUBST\n            ]\n          })\n        ]\n      }\n=======\n      { // heredocs\n        begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?(\\\\w+)\\\\n(?:[^\\\\n]*\\\\n)*?\\\\s*\\\\1\\\\b/,\n        returnBegin: true,\n        contains: [\n          {\n            begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?/\n          },\n          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({\n            begin: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            end: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            contains: [\n              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n              SUBST\n            ],\n            endsWithParent: true\n          })\n        ]\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `endsWithParent: true` option is added to ensure that the heredoc block is correctly terminated when the ending marker is reached, even if single quotes are used.\n- This change should allow the syntax highlighter to correctly identify and highlight heredocs without interpolation, as expected."
