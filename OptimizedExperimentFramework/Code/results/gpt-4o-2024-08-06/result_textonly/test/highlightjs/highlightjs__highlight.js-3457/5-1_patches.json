    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and identify the root cause of the issue where bold and italics formatting in Markdown is not being closed properly, causing the rest of the document to render incorrectly.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description:**\n   - The bug report indicates that when both bold and italics are applied to a piece of text, the closing characters for these styles are ignored, causing the rest of the document to render as bold and italics.\n   - The provided images show the text rendering incorrectly before the fix and correctly after the fix.\n\n2. **Root Cause:**\n   - The issue likely stems from the way the Markdown parser is handling nested bold and italics. The parser might not be correctly recognizing the end of the bold and italics sections, leading to the entire document being rendered with these styles.\n\n3. **Code Snippet Analysis:**\n   - The code snippet provided is a Markdown language definition for a syntax highlighter.\n   - The `BOLD` and `ITALIC` objects define the patterns for recognizing bold and italics text.\n   - The `BOLD.contains.push(ITALIC);` and `ITALIC.contains.push(BOLD);` lines suggest that the parser is set up to handle nested bold and italics, but there might be an issue with how these are being processed.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the parser correctly identifies the end of bold and italics sections. This can be done by adjusting the regex patterns or the way the parser processes these patterns.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const BOLD = {\n    className: 'strong',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /_{2}/,\n        end: /_{2}/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /\\*{2}/,\n        end: /\\*{2}/\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  const ITALIC = {\n    className: 'emphasis',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /\\*(?!\\*)/,\n        end: /\\*/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /_(?!_)/,\n        end: /_/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  BOLD.contains.push(ITALIC);\n  ITALIC.contains.push(BOLD);\n=======\n  const BOLD = {\n    className: 'strong',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /_{2}(?!_)/,\n        end: /_{2}/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /\\*{2}(?!\\*)/,\n        end: /\\*{2}/\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  const ITALIC = {\n    className: 'emphasis',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /\\*(?!\\*)/,\n        end: /\\*(?!\\*)/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /_(?!_)/,\n        end: /_(?!_)/\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  BOLD.contains.push(ITALIC);\n  ITALIC.contains.push(BOLD);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Fix\n\n- **BOLD Variants:**\n  - Updated the `begin` regex for bold to ensure it does not match sequences of more than two asterisks or underscores, which could cause the parser to miss the end of the bold section.\n\n- **ITALIC Variants:**\n  - Updated the `end` regex for italics to ensure it does not match sequences of more than one asterisk or underscore, which could cause the parser to miss the end of the italics section.\n\nThese changes should help the parser correctly identify the end of bold and italics sections, preventing the rest of the document from being incorrectly styled."
