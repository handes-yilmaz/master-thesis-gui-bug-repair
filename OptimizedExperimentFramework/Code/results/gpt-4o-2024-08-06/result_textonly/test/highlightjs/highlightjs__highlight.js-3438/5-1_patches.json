    "1/1": "To address the issue of C++ code not being rendered correctly, we need to analyze the provided bug report and code snippets. The bug report indicates that some C++ code is not being rendered, and the issue is related to the `highlight` function. The provided code snippets are from the `cpp.js` and `highlight.js` files, which are part of the syntax highlighting library.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report includes a sample C++ code snippet and mentions that the `highlight` function is used with the `cpp` language. The expected behavior is that the C++ code should be rendered with syntax highlighting, but it is not happening as expected. The issue might be related to the handling of specific C++ constructs or keywords in the `cpp.js` file, or it could be an issue with the `highlight` function in `highlight.js`.\n\n### Bug Localization\n1. **`src/languages/cpp.js`**: This file contains the language definition for C++. It includes regular expressions and configurations for C++ syntax highlighting. The issue might be related to missing or incorrect handling of certain C++ constructs or keywords.\n\n2. **`src/highlight.js`**: This file contains the core logic for syntax highlighting. The `highlight` function is responsible for applying the language-specific rules to the code. The issue might be related to how the `highlight` function processes the C++ code.\n\n### Bug Fixes\nBased on the analysis, we will make changes to the `cpp.js` file to ensure that all C++ constructs are correctly recognized and highlighted. We will also ensure that the `highlight` function in `highlight.js` is correctly configured to handle C++ code.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/cpp.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst FUNCTION_TYPE_RE = '(?!struct)(' +\n  DECLTYPE_AUTO_RE + '|' +\n  regex.optional(NAMESPACE_RE) +\n  '[a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*' + regex.optional(TEMPLATE_ARGUMENT_RE) +\n')';\n=======\nconst FUNCTION_TYPE_RE = '(?!struct|class)(' +\n  DECLTYPE_AUTO_RE + '|' +\n  regex.optional(NAMESPACE_RE) +\n  '[a-zA-Z_]\\\\w*' + regex.optional(TEMPLATE_ARGUMENT_RE) +\n')';\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **`cpp.js`**: The `FUNCTION_TYPE_RE` regular expression is updated to include `class` in the negative lookahead. This ensures that class declarations are not mistakenly identified as function types, which could lead to incorrect highlighting.\n\nThis change should help in correctly rendering C++ code by ensuring that all constructs are properly recognized and highlighted. If there are additional issues, further investigation into the specific constructs causing problems would be necessary."
