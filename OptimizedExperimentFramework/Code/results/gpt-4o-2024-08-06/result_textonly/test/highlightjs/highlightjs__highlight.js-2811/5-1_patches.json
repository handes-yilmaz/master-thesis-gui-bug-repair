    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that comments following decorators in Python code are correctly highlighted as comments (`hljs-comment`) rather than being incorrectly classified as metadata (`hljs-meta`). The problem arises because the current implementation does not properly handle comments on the same line as decorators.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that when a comment is placed on the same line as a decorator in Python code, the entire line is incorrectly given the `hljs-meta` class. This is evident from the provided screenshot, where the comment following the decorator is not greyed out as expected. The expected behavior is for the comment to be highlighted as a comment (`hljs-comment`), similar to how GitHub handles it.\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\nThe issue likely stems from the way the decorator lines are being parsed and classified in the `src/languages/python.js` file. Specifically, the section of code that handles decorators does not account for comments on the same line, leading to the entire line being classified as metadata.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the section of the code that handles decorators to ensure that comments are correctly identified and highlighted. We will update the relevant part of the `src/languages/python.js` file to include comment handling for lines with decorators.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      {\n        className: 'meta',\n        begin: /^[\\t ]*@/, end: /$/\n      },\n=======\n      {\n        className: 'meta',\n        begin: /^[\\t ]*@/,\n        end: /(?=#|$)/, // End at the start of a comment or end of line\n        contains: [hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE] // Include comment mode\n      },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original code classifies lines starting with `@` as metadata and ends at the end of the line.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The updated code changes the `end` pattern to stop at the beginning of a comment (`#`) or the end of the line. It also includes `hljs.HASH_COMMENT_MODE` in the `contains` array to ensure that comments are correctly highlighted as comments.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that comments following decorators are correctly highlighted as comments, aligning with the expected behavior described in the bug report."
