        "explanation": "1. **src/languages/python.js**: This file likely contains the syntax definitions specific to Python, including rules for decorators, comments, and other language-specific syntax that needs adjustment to correctly apply syntax highlighting for decorators with inline comments.\n\n2. **src/lib/modes.js**: This file probably defines general modes for language parsing and highlighting. Adjustments to how mixed syntax like decorators and comments interact might be necessary here, common among different languages or scenarios.\n\n3. **src/lib/regex.js**: Syntax highlighting heavily relies on regular expressions to identify code structures. Any changes to accurately parse and separate decorators and comments could require updates in this file.\n\n4. **src/lib/html_renderer.js**: This file handles the rendering of highlighted code into HTML. The incorrect application of classes (e.g., `hljs-meta` vs. `hljs-comment`) might require adjustments here to ensure that comments are properly identified and rendered with the correct styling.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to incorrect syntax highlighting for Python decorators in conjunction with comments. When a decorator and a comment appear on the same line in Python code, the highlight.js library incorrectly applies the `hljs-meta` class to the entire line, instead of marking the comment portion as `hljs-comment`. This results in the comment not being displayed in grey, as is standard for comments, leading to inconsistent visual formatting in rendered code examples."

        "explanation": "Based on the provided repository structure and bug report, the root of the problem seems to likely involve the syntax highlighting mechanism for Python, which can be found in `src/languages/python.js`. This file likely contains the language definitions that would include how decorators and comments are processed. \n\nIn addition, `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` may also be relevant, as ECMAScript could have shared syntax highlighting processes or utilities affecting multiple languages, including Python.\n\nFurthermore, `src/lib/modes.js` is likely involved since it may handle the matching and classification of code elements, such as decorators and comments, potentially affecting how these elements are detected and styled by the `highlight` function. These files together would be responsible for parsing the Python code and applying the correct syntax highlighting classes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when a comment is placed on the same line as a Python decorator. The syntax highlighting engine incorrectly assigns the entire line, including the comment, the `hljs-meta` class instead of differentiating the comment section with `hljs-comment`. This leads to the comment not being greyed out as expected."
