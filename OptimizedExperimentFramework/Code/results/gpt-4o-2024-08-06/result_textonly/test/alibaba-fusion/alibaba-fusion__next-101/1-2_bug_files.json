        "explanation": "1. **src/number-picker/index.jsx**: This file is likely the main implementation file for the NumberPicker component. Since the bug directly affects the incrementing functionality of this component, any floating-point arithmetic related to the step increase would be handled here, making it relevant to the bug.\n\n2. **src/util/index.js**: Utilities for handling numerical precision issues, especially related to floating-point arithmetic, are often included in generic utility scripts. If there is any number formatting or calculation logic, it would affect how increments and display values are computed.\n\n3. **src/util/string.js**: If the component converts numbers to strings for display or for handling precision (like formatting the output to a specific number of decimal places), the logic might reside in a utility string file. Issues with precision can sometimes be mitigated by adjusting how numbers are formatted or displayed, often handled by utility functions.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the NumberPicker component displaying an incorrect value due to JavaScript floating-point precision issues. Specifically, when the NumberPicker is incremented by clicking the '+' button starting from a value like 4.02 with a step of 0.01, it displays 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03. This issue is particularly observed in the Safari browser on macOS."

        "explanation": "1. `src/number-picker/index.jsx`: This is the main file containing the code for the `NumberPicker` component. Since the issue is directly related to how the component handles and updates its internal state with floating-point numbers, this file is the most relevant for investigating and addressing the bug.\n\n2. `src/number-picker/style.js`: Although primarily handling styles, this file could potentially involve any CSS affecting the display of numbers. Thus, any style-related adjustments due to the precision can be checked here if UI rendering issues occur.\n\n3. `src/util/func.js`: Utility functions often handle common numerical transformations and operations. If handling of floating-point arithmetic is abstracted into utility functions, this file may need to be adjusted to correctly format or round float numbers to the desired precision to prevent display errors.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the `NumberPicker` component where incrementing a float value using the component's \"+\" button shows a precision error in Safari browser. Due to this precision error inherent in JavaScript's handling of floating-point arithmetic, adding 0.01 to 4.02 results in 4.029999999999999 instead of 4.03, causing a visible display bug when the accuracy of two decimal places is expected."
