        "explanation": "1. **src/table/base/header.jsx**: This file is responsible for rendering the table header, including handling sorting, filtering, and resizing functionalities. The issue likely arises from how these features interact when both 'fixedHeader' and 'resizable' are enabled.\n\n2. **src/table/fixed/header.jsx**: This file manages the fixed header component. Since the bug occurs when 'fixedHeader' is used, this file is crucial for understanding how the fixed header is implemented and interacts with other components.\n\n3. **src/table/base/filter.jsx**: This file handles the filter functionality in the table header. Given that the bug is triggered by clicking the filter button, this file is relevant to the issue.\n\n4. **src/table/base/resize.jsx**: This file manages the resizing functionality of the table columns. Since the bug involves the 'resizable' feature, this file is key to understanding how resizing is implemented and potentially causing the header display issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a table component where the header displays abnormally when both 'fixedHeader' and 'resizable' features are used together. The issue is observed when clicking the filter button, causing the header to not render correctly."
