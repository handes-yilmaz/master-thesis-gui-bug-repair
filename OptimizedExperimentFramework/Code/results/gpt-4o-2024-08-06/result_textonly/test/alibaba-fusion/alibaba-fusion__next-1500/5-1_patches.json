    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that when using `fixedHeader` and `resizable` together, the table header's filter options display abnormally. This suggests a potential issue with how the components are rendered or interact with each other.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe image in the bug report shows a table header with misaligned or improperly displayed filter options when both `fixedHeader` and `resizable` features are enabled. This could be due to incorrect handling of component rendering or state management when these features are combined.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause likely lies in the interaction between the `Header`, `Filter`, and `Resize` components. Specifically, the issue may arise from how these components are rendered or how their states are managed when both `fixedHeader` and `resizable` are active. The `Filter` component's visibility or positioning might be affected by the `Resize` component's actions, leading to the abnormal display.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue is likely in the `src/table/base/header.jsx` file, where the `Filter` and `Resize` components are used together. We need to ensure that the `Filter` component's visibility and positioning are correctly managed when the `Resize` component is active.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n```javascript\n### src/table/base/header.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                    if (resizable) {\n                        resizeElement = (\n                            <Resize\n                                prefix={prefix}\n                                rtl={rtl}\n                                dataIndex={dataIndex}\n                                onChange={onResizeChange}\n                            />\n                        );\n                    }\n\n                    if (filters) {\n                        filterElement = filters.length ?

By rendering the `Filter` component before the `Resize` component, we ensure that the filter options are not affected by the resizing actions, which might have been causing the abnormal display. This change should help maintain the correct visibility and positioning of the filter options when both features are enabled."
