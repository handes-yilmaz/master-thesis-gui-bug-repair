        "explanation": "Based on the repository structure and the description of the bug report, files within the 'src/cascader/' directory are likely to be directly related to this bug, specifically the 'cascader.jsx' which might handle component rendering logic, the 'utils.js' for any utility functions related to the title handling, and 'menu.jsx' for menu display logic. The 'index.jsx' is typically the entry point of the Cascader component, which might need changes to include the new API configuration.\n\nAdditionally, since the bug report mentions 'Tree' which seems to indicate a relationship or extension with the Cascader component, files in the 'src/tree/view/' directory like 'tree.jsx' and 'util.js' might be involved if the tree structure aspect affects the Cascader's appearance or behavior related to titles.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that for the Cascader component (related to Cascader / Tree components), there is a need to provide an API to remove the title information. The provided URL in the bug report leads to an image which was expected to illustrate the feature, but currently, it cannot be accessed from this context. However, the request is straightforward: users need a way to programmatically hide or remove the title in the Cascader component."

        "explanation": "The identified bug pertains to the Cascader component, requiring an API to remove or modify the title information. The files within the `src/cascader/` directory, such as `cascader.jsx`, `index.jsx`, `item.jsx`, `menu.jsx`, and `utils.js`, are likely involved because they contain core logic and components related to the functionality of the Cascader. These files will likely need modifications to add or modify the APIs necessary for altering the title attribute behavior. Furthermore, considering the Tree component is mentioned, files in `src/tree/view/`, such as `tree.jsx` and `tree-node.jsx`, may also be relevant if similar issues or changes related to title attributes are present in the Tree's node elements or utility functions. These files are related to rendering and managing tree nodes, which could also involve title attributes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the Cascader and Tree components, specifically a request for an API to remove the title attribute from these components. This would imply that the Cascader and possibly related Tree component titles are undesired for some reason, potentially for UI simplification or customization purposes."
