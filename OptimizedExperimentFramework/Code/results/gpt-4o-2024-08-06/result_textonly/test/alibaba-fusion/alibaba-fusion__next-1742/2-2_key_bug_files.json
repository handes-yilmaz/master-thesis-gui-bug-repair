        "explanation": "1. **src/cascader/cascader.jsx**: This file contains the main implementation of the Cascader component. Since the request is to provide an API to remove the title information, changes would likely need to be made here to add a new prop or method that allows for the title to be omitted.\n\n2. **src/cascader/index.jsx**: This file exports the Cascader component and includes configuration transformations. If a new API is added to the Cascader component, this file might need to be updated to handle any new props or configuration options related to the removal of the title information.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Cascader component, where there is a request to provide an API option to remove the title information from the component. The image linked in the bug report likely shows the current state of the Cascader component with the title information that the user wants to be able to remove via an API."
