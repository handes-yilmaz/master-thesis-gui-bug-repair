        "explanation": "The class 'Cascader' within the 'src/cascader/cascader.jsx' file is identified as a key element related to the bug because it is the main component class handling the Cascader functionality. Any changes to the API to allow the removal of the title information would likely need to be implemented within this class, as it should manage the rendering and properties of the Cascader component, including title handling.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a request to provide an API option in the Cascader component to remove the title information, as depicted in the provided image link. This suggests that users want more control over the display properties of the Cascader, specifically the ability to hide or show the title."

        "explanation": "The class 'Cascader' in 'src/cascader/cascader.jsx' is the main class responsible for the Cascader component, which is where the feature request to remove title information would be implemented. The current class contains various methods and properties related to the data and presentation of the Cascader component. To implement the feature, changes will likely need to be made within this class to introduce an API that manages the title visibility. The file 'src/cascader/index.jsx' primarily handles configuration and exporting and does not directly deal with rendering or managing title properties, so it is less relevant for the bug fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a request to provide an API in the Cascader component that allows the removal of title information, as indicated in the bug report. The attached image suggests that the current implementation displays titles that the user wants to be optionally removed through an API."
