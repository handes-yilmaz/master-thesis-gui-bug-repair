        "explanation": "The issue is reported with the CascaderSelect component, specifically when using the 'v2' version of the popup. Therefore, the main files responsible for the CascaderSelect functionality, namely 'src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx' and 'src/cascader-select/index.jsx', are directly related to this issue. Additionally, since the bug involves the 'v2' version of the popup, it is likely implemented in the 'src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx' and 'src/overlay/overlay-v2.jsx' files, which handle the rendering and logic for popup features in version 2. These files are typically involved in managing the display properties and lifecycle of such popups, and modifications here might have led to the error encountered.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the CascaderSelect component in a UI library. When the popup property 'v2' is enabled ('v2: true'), an error is triggered. The bug appears to be in the handling of the 'popup' feature within this component, which likely leads to a runtime error, as depicted in the provided screenshot showing an error message or exception stack trace."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the `CascaderSelect` component, specifically when using the popupProps with `v2: true`. The files `src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx` and `src/cascader-select/index.jsx` are directly involved because they define the CascaderSelect component's behavior and integration with the popup mechanism. The `src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx` and `src/overlay/index.jsx` are involved as they likely define and implement the Popup version 2 functionality, which seems to be causing the error when integrated with CascaderSelect.",
        "bug_scenario": "The provided bug report indicates an error occurring when using the CascaderSelect component in a project. The error arises when the popup is opened using version 2 of the popup (v2) as specified in the `popupProps`. A screenshot highlights the error details, which points to a stack trace involving the CascaderSelect component, implying an unhandled issue or unexpected behavior in its implementation when v2 is enabled."
