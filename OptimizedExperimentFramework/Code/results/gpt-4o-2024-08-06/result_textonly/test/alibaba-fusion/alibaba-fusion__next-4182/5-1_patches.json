    "1/1": "To address the bug reported in the CascaderSelect component when enabling popup v2, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The error message in the bug report suggests that there is a problem with the popup v2 implementation.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that when the `v2` property is set to `true` in the `popupProps`, an error occurs. The error message in the image suggests that there might be an issue with the rendering or configuration of the popup component when using the v2 version.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nUpon reviewing the code snippets, the issue seems to be related to the handling of the `v2` property in the `Overlay` and `Popup` components. Specifically, the `Popup` component in `src/overlay/index.jsx` is responsible for rendering either `Popup1` or `Popup2` based on the `v2` flag. The error might be due to incorrect handling or missing properties when rendering `Popup2`.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue likely resides in the `src/overlay/index.jsx` file, where the `Popup` component decides which version of the popup to render. We need to ensure that the properties are correctly passed to `Popup2` and that any necessary adjustments are made for compatibility with the v2 implementation.\n\n### Patches\nLet's generate the necessary patches to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/overlay/index.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            return <Popup2 {...others} />;\n=======\n            return <Popup2 {...others} ref={this.saveRef} />;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The patch adds a `ref` to the `Popup2` component, similar to how it is done for `Popup1`. This ensures that the `saveRef` function is called, which might be necessary for the correct functioning of the popup component, especially if the `overlay` reference is used elsewhere in the code.\n\nBy applying this patch, we ensure that the `Popup2` component is correctly initialized and any necessary references are maintained, potentially resolving the error encountered when enabling popup v2."
