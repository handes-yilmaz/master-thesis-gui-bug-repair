        "explanation": "1. **src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx**: This file is the main implementation of the CascaderSelect component. Since the bug report mentions an issue with the CascaderSelect component when using popupProps with v2: true, this file is directly involved in the bug. It likely contains the logic for handling popupProps and integrating with the popup component.\n\n2. **src/overlay/popup-v2.jsx**: This file contains the implementation of the Popup component version 2. The bug report specifically mentions an error when using popup v2, indicating that the issue might be within this file. The logic for rendering and managing the popup's visibility and animations is crucial for resolving the error.\n\n3. **src/overlay/index.jsx**: This file manages the export and configuration of different overlay components, including Popup and Popup2. It contains logic to switch between different versions of the popup based on the v2 prop. Since the error occurs when v2 is true, this file is relevant for understanding how the application decides which popup version to use and might contain the root cause of the error.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the CascaderSelect component in a React application. When the popupProps is set with v2: true, an error occurs. The provided image shows a screenshot of the error message in the console, indicating a problem with the popup version 2 implementation."
