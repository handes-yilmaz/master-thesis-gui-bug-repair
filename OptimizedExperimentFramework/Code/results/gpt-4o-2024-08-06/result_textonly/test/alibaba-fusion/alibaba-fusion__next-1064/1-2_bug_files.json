        "explanation": "1. 'src/field/index.js': This file is directly referenced in the bug report, indicating that it contains crucial logic for the Field component. Since the problem is that the Field component cannot modify incoming data, this file likely includes the code responsible for applying or rejecting these modifications.\n\n2. 'src/field/utils.js': This file might contain utility functions used across the Field component for data manipulation or validation. Since these are systemic functions for the Field logic, any bug related to data modification could originate or be affected here.\n\n3. 'src/form/index.js' and 'src/form/item.js': Forms typically work closely with field components, and issues with data handling in the Field component might have roots or effects in form setup and behaviors. Since forms rely on fields to manage and handle input values, bugs in field value handling may reflect in the form logic in these files. Overall, they could contain integrating logic between the form and its fields.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the 'Field' component which does not allow modifications to the data it receives. The report refers to a specific line in 'field/index.js', suggesting that the issue is with how data mutations are handled or prevented in this file."

        "explanation": "The bug report specifically mentions the Field component, which directly indicates that the problem lies within the Field module. In the provided repository structure, the 'src/field/' directory contains files related to this component. The 'index.js' file in this directory is likely the main entry point and contains essential logic for the Field component's behavior. Additionally, the 'utils.js' file may contain utility functions that support the Field component, which might also contribute to the issue. These files need to be investigated to diagnose and resolve the issue concerning data modification.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report pertains to an issue with a component named 'Field' in the application. The issue is described as an inability to modify the data that is passed into this component. This indicates a potential problem in the component's handling of state or props, preventing expected updates or changes."
