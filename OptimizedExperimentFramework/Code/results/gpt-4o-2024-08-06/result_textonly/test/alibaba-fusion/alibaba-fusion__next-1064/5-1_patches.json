    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `Field` component does not modify the input data. The problem seems to be related to how the `Field` class handles the `values` object, particularly when initializing and setting values. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify the root cause and generate the necessary patches.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\nThe bug report indicates that the `Field` component should not alter the input data. This suggests that the `Field` class might be directly modifying the `values` object passed in the `options` parameter, which is not intended behavior. Instead, the `Field` class should work with a copy of the input data to avoid unintended side effects.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe potential issue lies in the constructor of the `Field` class, where the `values` object is assigned directly from `options.values`. This can lead to modifications of the original input data if the `Field` class alters `this.values`.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix this issue, we should ensure that `this.values` is initialized as a copy of `options.values` rather than a direct reference. This can be achieved by using a shallow copy of the `values` object.\n\nHere is the patch to address the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/field/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        this.values = options.values || {};\n=======\n        this.values = Object.assign({}, options.values) || {};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original code directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values`, which can lead to modifications of the input data.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The updated code uses `Object.assign({}, options.values)` to create a shallow copy of the `values` object. This ensures that any modifications to `this.values` do not affect the original `options.values`.\n\nThis patch ensures that the `Field` component does not modify the input data, addressing the issue described in the bug report."
