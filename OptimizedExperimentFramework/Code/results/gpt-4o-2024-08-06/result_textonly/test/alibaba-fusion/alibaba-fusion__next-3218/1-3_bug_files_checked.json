        "explanation": "The problem is described as a styling issue related to the Select component demos. The files related to the Select component in the repository are likely to contain the styles or logic that enforce these styles. Specifically: \n- `src/select/index.jsx`: This is likely the entry point for the Select component functionality or demo, where the component or demo setup is coded.\n- `src/select/main.scss`: This file probably contains global styles applied to the Select component, which could be causing the styling issues.\n- `src/select/select.jsx`: As a primary component file, it may contain specific rendering logic where styles are enforced or manipulated.\n- `src/select/style.js`: This file might dynamically apply or control styling aspects, contributing to the described problem in the demos. Adjustments in these files may be necessary to ensure the Select component behaves as expected across different demos without unwanted style interference.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue in a demo of a \"Select\" component where the styling is too rigid and affecting other demos inappropriately. The provided images would show how the styling is applied incorrectly, causing visual problems across different instances or examples of the component."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the Select component, as indicated in the bug report. The files most likely containing the issue are the main JavaScript and styling files for the Select component.\\n- `src/select/select.jsx`: This is the main JavaScript file for the Select component where the logic and structure are defined. If there are structural issues leading to display problems, this file might need modifications.\\n- `src/select/main.scss`: This is the main stylesheet for the Select component. Since the issue is specifically about styling errors (styles being too absolute), this file likely contains the problematic CSS rules.\\n- `src/select/style.js`: This file may contain JS-driven styles or style imports that also affect the component\u2019s appearance.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that the Select component's demo is causing display issues, and some styles written are overly restrictive, affecting the layout of other components. The images provided in the bug report show that the dropdowns or selection boxes of the Select component overlap with other elements or extend beyond expected borders, leading to a cluttered interface, likely because of CSS style issues."
