        "explanation": "The bug is related to the Select component's styling and functionality. The issue is that the styles are too rigid and affect other demos. The 'Select' class in both 'src/select/index.jsx' and 'src/select/select.jsx' are crucial as they define the Select component and its configurations. \n\nThe 'transform' function in 'src/select/index.jsx' is responsible for transforming the props, and it deals with deprecated props and their new counterparts; it might need adjustments to ensure proper functionality and styling.\n\nThe 'handleSearchClear' and 'handleMenuSelect' functions in 'src/select/select.jsx' are likely related to the bug because they handle events related to the search and menu selection, which are integral to the Select component's functionality. These functions might be involved in how the component's UI behaves when interacting with it, which could lead to style issues seen in the documentation.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Select component demo in the documentation displaying incorrectly. The styles of some Select demos are too rigid, affecting other demos. The images show that the Select component's dropdown menu or input field is not styled or functioning as expected, likely overlapping or not rendering properly."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the styling and functionality of the Select component, as indicated by the bug report. The 'Select' classes in 'index.jsx' and 'select.jsx' are central to the component's functionality and rendering, making them key places to investigate for issues impacting demo displays. Additionally, the 'transform' function in 'select.jsx' is responsible for adapting and modifying properties, which could be contributing to the styling issues if not handling styles or properties correctly. Adjustments in these areas might resolve the demo styling conflicts.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an issue where the styling in the Select component's demo is too rigid, affecting other demos. This is evident from the images provided, which likely show visual inconsistencies or layout issues in the rendered Select components across different demos."
