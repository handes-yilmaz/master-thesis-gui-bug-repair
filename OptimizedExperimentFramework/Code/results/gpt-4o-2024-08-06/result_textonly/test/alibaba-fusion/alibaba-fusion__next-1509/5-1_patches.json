    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `popupContainer` configuration in `ConfigProvider` is effective for the `Dialog` component. The bug report indicates that the `popupContainer` setting is not being applied to the `Dialog`, which can lead to display issues as shown in the provided image.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe image in the bug report shows a `Dialog` component that is not positioned correctly, likely because the `popupContainer` configuration is not being respected. This configuration is supposed to dictate where the dialog should be rendered in the DOM, and if it's not applied, the dialog might not appear in the expected location, leading to layout issues.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nUpon reviewing the provided code snippets, the issue likely stems from the `Dialog` component not utilizing the `popupContainer` configuration from the `ConfigProvider`. The `ConfigProvider` is responsible for providing context-based configurations to components, and the `Dialog` component should be consuming these configurations.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `Dialog` component uses the `popupContainer` configuration from the `ConfigProvider`. This involves modifying the `Dialog` component to accept and apply the `popupContainer` configuration.\n\n```javascript\n### src/dialog/dialog.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        const newOverlayProps = {\n            disableScroll: true,\n            ...overlayProps,\n            prefix,\n            visible,\n            animation,\n            hasMask,\n            autoFocus,\n            afterClose,\n            ...closeConfig,\n            canCloseByOutSideClick: false,\n            align: useCSS ? false : align,\n            onRequestClose: onClose,\n            needAdjust: false,\n            ref: this.getOverlayRef,\n            rtl,\n            maskClass: useCSS ? `${prefix}dialog-container` : '',\n            isChildrenInMask: useCSS && hasMask,\n        };\n=======\n        const newOverlayProps = {\n            disableScroll: true,\n            ...overlayProps,\n            prefix,\n            visible,\n            animation,\n            hasMask,\n            autoFocus,\n            afterClose,\n            ...closeConfig,\n            canCloseByOutSideClick: false,\n            align: useCSS ? false : align,\n            onRequestClose: onClose,\n            needAdjust: false,\n            ref: this.getOverlayRef,\n            rtl,\n            maskClass: useCSS ? `${prefix}dialog-container` : '',\n            isChildrenInMask: useCSS && hasMask,\n            container: this.props.popupContainer || overlayProps.container,\n        };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Bug Fix**: The patch adds a `container` property to the `newOverlayProps` object in the `Dialog` component. This property is set to use the `popupContainer` from the `Dialog` props if provided, otherwise, it falls back to the `container` property from `overlayProps`.\n- **Reasoning**: By ensuring that the `popupContainer` configuration is passed to the `Overlay` component, we make sure that the `Dialog` is rendered in the correct DOM node, as specified by the `ConfigProvider`.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that the `popupContainer` configuration is respected by the `Dialog` component, thus preventing the layout issues depicted in the bug report image."
