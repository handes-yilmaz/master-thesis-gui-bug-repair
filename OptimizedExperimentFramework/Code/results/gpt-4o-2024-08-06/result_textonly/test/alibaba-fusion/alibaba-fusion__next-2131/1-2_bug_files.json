        "explanation": "The bug report specifically mentions an issue involving immutable data and keys within the Tree component. Given this context, the directory path `src/tree/` directly aligns with the Tree component mentioned in the bug report. The files likely affected by this bug due to their roles in rendering or managing Tree state are:\n\n1. `src/tree/view/tree.jsx`: This file is presumably responsible for the core functionality and rendering logic of the Tree component, where the handling of keys in the context of immutable data structures would be implemented.\n2. `src/tree/view/util.js`: Utility files often contain helper functions that manage or transform data\u2014such as the key assignment for tree nodes\u2014making this file a candidate for investigation.\n3. `src/tree/index.jsx`: This file likely serves as the main entry point for the Tree component and might hold high-level logic that interfaces with other parts of the application or framework, including processing keys for tree nodes.\n\nThese files are considered because they handle or orchestrate key rendering and data management processes for the Tree component, which are areas directly affected by the bug as described in the report and illustrated by the images.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that there is an issue with the Tree component after an upgrade from version 1.19.x to 1.20.23. The images show the difference in the behavior or visual rendering of the Tree component in these two versions, which helps to illustrate the bug by comparing the working and non-working instances."

            "src/tree/view/util.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "Based on the bug description targeting the `Tree` component specifically, the files most likely related to the bug include `tree-node.jsx` and `tree.jsx` as these directly manage the tree structure and node representations in the UI. The `util.js` file is also listed because utility functions related to key management or node mapping might involve operations with immutable data keys. These files accordingly need a thorough review and potential fixing for key handling in tree data structures.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a problem with the Tree component, where an immutable data key was added incorrectly. The bug appears when users upgrade from version 1.19.x to 1.20.23, causing unexpected behavior in the Tree component as depicted in the attached images, which show an error in the rendering of tree nodes or unexpected console errors."
