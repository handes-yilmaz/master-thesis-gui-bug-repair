        "explanation": "The bug report suggests a CSS styling issue where the overlay content collapses due to lack of space. The file 'src/overlay/main.scss' is likely a key file because it contains the styling definitions for the overlay, including the '.overlay-wrapper' and '.overlay-backdrop' classes. Adding 'width: 100%' to the relevant CSS class in this file would address the issue described in the bug report. Additionally, 'src/overlay/overlay.jsx' is a key file because it is the main component file for the Overlay, and any changes to how the overlay is rendered or styled at the component level would be made here. This file might need adjustments to ensure the CSS changes are applied correctly or to handle any component-level logic related to the overlay's display.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an issue with the Overlay component where inline content collapses due to insufficient space for the browser to render it properly. The suggested solution is to add 'width: 100%' to ensure the content is displayed correctly."
