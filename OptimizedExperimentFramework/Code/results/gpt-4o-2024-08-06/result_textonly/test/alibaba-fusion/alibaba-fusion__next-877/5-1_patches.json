    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the overlay content does not collapse when it is inline and there is no space for the browser to render it. The suggested solution is to add `width: 100%` to the overlay content. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to locate where this change should be applied.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that the overlay content collapses when it is inline and there is insufficient space for rendering. The provided image (not visible here) likely shows the overlay content not being displayed correctly due to this issue. The root cause is likely a missing CSS style that ensures the overlay content takes up the full available width.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is likely located in the rendering or styling section of the `Overlay` component. We need to find where the overlay content is styled or rendered and apply the necessary CSS changes.\n\n### Patch Generation\nLet's generate a patch to add `width: 100%` to the overlay content to prevent it from collapsing.\n\n```javascript\n### src/overlay/overlay.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    render() {\n        const { className, style, children, ...others } = this.props;\n        const wrapperStyle = {\n            ...style,\n        };\n=======\n    render() {\n        const { className, style, children, ...others } = this.props;\n        const wrapperStyle = {\n            ...style,\n            width: '100%', // Ensure the overlay content takes full width\n        };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Location**: The patch is applied in the `render` method of the `Overlay` component, where the `wrapperStyle` is defined.\n- **Change**: We added `width: '100%'` to the `wrapperStyle` object to ensure that the overlay content takes up the full width available, preventing it from collapsing when inline.\n\nThis change should resolve the issue by ensuring that the overlay content is rendered with the correct width, as suggested in the bug report."
