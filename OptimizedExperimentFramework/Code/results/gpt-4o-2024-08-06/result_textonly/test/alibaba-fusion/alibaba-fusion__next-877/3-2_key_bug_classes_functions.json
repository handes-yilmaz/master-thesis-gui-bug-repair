        "explanation": "The bug is related to the rendering of inline content in the Overlay component. The Overlay class in the 'src/overlay/overlay.jsx' is responsible for the behavior and rendering of the overlay elements. The issue described in the bug report suggests that the overlay's content collapses due to rendering constraints. By setting the width to 100%, the rendering issue can be resolved. Thus, the Overlay class is the key element that needs modification to fix the bug as it governs the visual and layout properties of the overlay, which are crucial to addressing the described rendering issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Overlay component where inline content collapses due to insufficient space for the browser to render it. The issue can be resolved by setting the width to 100% to ensure proper rendering."

        "explanation": "The Overlay class in the 'src/overlay/overlay.jsx' file is the core component responsible for rendering and managing the overlay's behavior and appearance. Since the bug is related to the overlay's inability to properly render inline content due to spacing issues, changes to ensure proper sizing (such as setting 'width: 100%') need to be made within this class. The bug report specifically mentions adjusting the overlay's style to fix the collapse issue, pointing directly to this class as the area where the fix should be implemented.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an issue with the Overlay component where inline content collapses due to insufficient space for rendering. This can be resolved by adding 'width: 100%' to ensure the content is rendered properly within the available space."
