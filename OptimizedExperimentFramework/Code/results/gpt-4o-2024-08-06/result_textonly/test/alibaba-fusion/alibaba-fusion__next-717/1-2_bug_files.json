        "explanation": "1. **src/select/select.jsx**: This file likely contains the implementation of the Select component. Since the bug is related to the Select component not displaying the default value correctly when fillProps is used, this file is crucial to investigate the handling of props, particularly fillProps, and defaultValue.\n\n2. **src/select/util.js**: This file might include utility functions used by the Select component for managing its behavior related to data handling and default values. If there is logic to process dataSource or fillProps, it would be relevant to debug this issue.\n\nBoth files are potential locations for logic handling the display of values based on props, making them key suspects in this bug scenario.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when using the Select component with the fillProps attribute set to 'name' and providing a defaultValue of 'jack'. The issue is that the default value, 'jack', is not being displayed when the dataSource is empty."

        "explanation": "The primary component involved in this bug is the `Select` component, which can be found within the `src/select/` directory. The critical files related to the rendering and functionality of the `Select` component include:\n\n1. `base.jsx`: This file likely contains the foundational code for the Select component, including its rendering logic. Issues related to default values or incorrect rendering might be resolved here by ensuring the default is used properly even if dataSource is empty.\n\n2. `select.jsx`: This is probably the main component file where the rendering logic for displaying the selected value is defined. It might be responsible for handling props like `fillProps` and `defaultValue`, and any oversight in handling these props could cause the described bug.\n\n3. `util.js`: Utility functions that facilitate operations within the Select component typically reside here. If there are helper functions responsible for prop values or data handling, this file is relevant for troubleshooting why 'jack' is not displayed.\n\n4. `data-store.js`: As the absence of dataSource influences the bug, this file might oversee data management, including default and fallback data behaviors which would be crucial to inspect for this bug.\n\nThese files collectively govern the behavior of the Select component and how it manages and displays values, making them directly relevant to the bug in question.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the described bug scenario, when a `Select` component in a React application is rendered using the code `ReactDOM.render(<Select fillProps=\"name\" defaultValue=\"jack\" ></Select>, mountNode);`, the expected display value 'jack' is not visible when the dataSource is empty. The intended functionality is for the component to display 'jack' as the selected value in absence of specific data from the dataSource, but it currently fails to do so."
