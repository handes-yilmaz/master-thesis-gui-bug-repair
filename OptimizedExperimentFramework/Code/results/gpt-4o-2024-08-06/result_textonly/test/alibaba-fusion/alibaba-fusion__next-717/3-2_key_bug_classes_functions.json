        "explanation": "The bug is related to the 'Select' component not displaying a default value when 'dataSource' is empty. The 'Select' class in 'select.jsx' is directly responsible for rendering the component and managing its properties and state, including handling the 'fillProps' attribute. The 'DataStore' class in 'data-store.js' manages the data source for the component, which is critical in this scenario as the dataSource is empty, affecting the default value handling. The 'getValueDataSource' function in 'util.js' is responsible for computing the valueDataSource by mapping the value, which is crucial when dealing with default values and empty data sources. These elements are key to understanding and resolving the bug as they interact closely with the component's data handling and rendering logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a 'Select' component in a React application where the 'fillProps' attribute is used with an empty 'dataSource'. The issue arises when a default value is set (e.g., 'jack') but is not displayed as expected in the Select component. This is evident in the provided image where the expected value 'jack' does not appear."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Select component not displaying the default value as expected. In the compressed bug files, the Select component is defined in 'src/select/select.jsx', which is directly involved in rendering the Select element and handling its properties like fillProps and defaultValue. This class is crucial to investigate as it manages how the Select component is initialized and displayed.\n\nFurthermore, the function 'getValueDataSource' in 'src/select/util.js' is responsible for computing the value data source by new values. This function handles the mapping and retrieval of values based on the dataSource, which is a critical part of how values are displayed in the Select component. Since the bug involves the display of a default value when the dataSource is empty, any issues in this function could lead to the observed bug behavior.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a Select component in a React application where the expected default value ('jack') is not displayed when using the fillProps attribute with an empty dataSource. The issue is observed in the image where the Select input is empty instead of displaying 'jack'."
