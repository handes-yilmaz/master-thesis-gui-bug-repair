        "explanation": "The bug relates to the `dataIndex` handling in the Table component. Upon inspecting the repository, the relevant files that would potentially handle the logic and rendering of table data handling are:\n\n1. `src/table/util.js` - This utility file is likely handling various table-specific logic or transformations needed for rendering data, which includes how `dataIndex` is processed.\n\n2. `src/table/index.jsx` - As the main entry file for the table component, it would orchestrate various functionalities of the table, including configuration parsing where `dataIndex` adjustments might be needed.\n\n3. `src/table/base/column.jsx` - Columns are directly related to `dataIndex` as this is the primary property used to identify data within each column, so it\u2019s likely contributing to how `dataIndex` is interpreted.\n\n4. `src/table/base/body.jsx` - This file likely deals with the rendering of body rows of the table, which would utilize `dataIndex` to fetch and display the correct data from the datasource.\n\nTo improve the compatibility with `'[start, end]'` strings for `dataIndex`, these identified files are likely candidates for modifications.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a compatibility issue in the Table component, where the `dataIndex` should support a syntax like `'[start, end]'`. The provided images show several instances related to a table structure with various components or values potentially linked with the `dataIndex`."

        "explanation": "1. `src/table/index.jsx`: This is likely the main file for the Table component, where prop parsing and component logic are initially handled, including `dataIndex` management.\n2. `src/table/util.js`: Utility files often contain helper functions related to data handling, transformations, or format parsing that might be responsible for manipulating the `dataIndex` values.\n3. `src/table/column.jsx`: Columns are fundamental to tables, and this file probably deals with column-specific configurations, including data extraction and rendering based on `dataIndex` values.\n4. `src/table/base/cell.jsx`: As cells are the interface between data properties and their visual representation, any issue with `dataIndex` interpretations could be handled within cell rendering logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the `Table` component where the `dataIndex` does not support complex string values like `'[start, end]'`. This issue is causing problems because, despite having no inherent meaning, support for such formats is needed for business purposes. The images attached to the report seem to illustrate an error or unexpected behavior occurring due to this unsupported format, likely showing warnings, errors, or incorrect display of data within a table."
