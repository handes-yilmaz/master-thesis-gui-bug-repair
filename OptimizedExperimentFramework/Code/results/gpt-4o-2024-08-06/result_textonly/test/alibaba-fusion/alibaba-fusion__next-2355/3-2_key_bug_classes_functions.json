        "explanation": "The class 'Column' in 'src/table/column.jsx' is directly related to the bug as it handles the 'dataIndex' prop, which is the focus of the bug report. Modifying this class might be necessary to accommodate the new string format requirement for 'dataIndex'. The function 'fetchDataByPath' in 'src/table/util.js' is also crucial as it processes the 'dataIndex' to retrieve data from objects. Enhancements in this function might be required to parse and handle the '[start, end]' string format correctly, ensuring that data retrieval logic aligns with the new requirements.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves enhancing the compatibility of the 'dataIndex' in a Table component to support string formats like '[start, end]'. This feature, while seemingly without practical significance, is needed for specific business requirements. The issue is visualized through images showing the current state where this string format is not supported, leading to incorrect data retrieval or display."

        "explanation": "The class 'Column' in 'src/table/column.jsx' is directly related to the bug because it defines the 'dataIndex' prop, which is the focus of the bug report. Modifying how 'dataIndex' handles complex string formats would likely involve changes to this class.\n\nThe function 'fetchDataByPath' in 'src/table/util.js' is responsible for extracting data from objects based on a 'path', which often corresponds to 'dataIndex'. As the bug involves enhancing the handling of 'dataIndex', this function is likely involved in parsing and retrieving the data for the table columns and would need to be modified to support the new string format '[start, end]'.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Table component, specifically the need for the 'dataIndex' to support string formats like '[start, end]'. Although such a string format may not have practical meaning, it is required for business purposes. The images depict scenarios where this feature is needed, likely showing the current inability of the component to handle such formats effectively."
