        "explanation": "1. **src/table/util.js**: This file contains the `fetchDataByPath` function, which is responsible for retrieving data from an object based on a path string. The function currently supports paths with dot notation and array indices (e.g., `lists[1].name`). To support the requested feature, this function would need to be modified to handle the new string format `'[start, end]'`.\n\n2. **src/table/column.jsx**: This file defines the `Column` component, which includes a `dataIndex` prop. The `dataIndex` is used to specify the field corresponding to a column, and it supports quick value retrieval using dot notation. To accommodate the new string format, changes might be needed in how `dataIndex` is processed or validated within this component.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a compatibility issue with the `dataIndex` property in a Table component. The user wants the `dataIndex` to support strings in the format `'[start, end]'`, which currently does not have practical meaning but is required for business purposes. The images provided show a table setup where this feature is likely being tested or demonstrated, highlighting the need for this compatibility enhancement."
