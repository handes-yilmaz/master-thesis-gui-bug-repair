    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to enhance the compatibility of the `dataIndex` property in the `Table` component to support string formats like `'[start, end]'`. The issue seems to be related to how the `dataIndex` is parsed and used to fetch data from an object. The current implementation likely does not handle such string formats correctly.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Root Cause Reasoning\nThe images provided in the bug report likely show examples of how the `dataIndex` is being used and the errors or unexpected behavior that occurs when using a string format like `'[start, end]'`. The root cause of the bug is that the current implementation of the `fetchDataByPath` function does not correctly parse and handle `dataIndex` values that are formatted as strings with brackets.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe relevant code for handling `dataIndex` is in the `fetchDataByPath` function in `src/table/util.js`. This function is responsible for parsing the `dataIndex` and fetching the corresponding data from an object. The current implementation splits the `dataIndex` by `.` and handles array indices using regular expressions. However, it does not account for the possibility of the entire `dataIndex` being a string with brackets.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the bug, we need to modify the `fetchDataByPath` function to correctly handle `dataIndex` values that are formatted as strings with brackets. We will update the function to parse such strings and fetch the corresponding data.\n\n```javascript\n### src/table/util.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    const field = path.split('.');\n    let val, key;\n    if (field.length) {\n        key = field[0];\n        // lists[1].name\n        if (key.indexOf('[') >= 0) {\n            key = key.match(/(.*)\\\\[(.*)\\\\]/);\n            if (key) {\n                val = object[key[1]][key[2]];\n            }\n        } else {\n            val = object[field[0]];\n        }\n        if (val) {\n            for (let colIndex = 1; colIndex < field.length; colIndex++) {\n                val = val[field[colIndex]];\n                if (typeof val === 'undefined') {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n=======\n    const field = path.match(/([^[.\\]]+)/g);\n    let val = object;\n    for (let i = 0; i < field.length; i++) {\n        if (val === undefined) {\n            return undefined;\n        }\n        val = val[field[i]];\n    }\n    return val;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n- The updated `fetchDataByPath` function uses a regular expression to split the `dataIndex` into its components, whether they are separated by `.` or enclosed in brackets `[]`.\n- It then iteratively accesses each part of the path on the object, handling both dot notation and bracket notation uniformly.\n- This change allows the function to correctly handle `dataIndex` values like `'[start, end]'`, as well as more traditional dot-separated paths."
