        "explanation": "The class 'Sort' in 'src/table/base/sort.jsx' is responsible for rendering the sorting functionality of the table component. The 'renderSort' function specifically handles the rendering of the sorting icons within the table header. Since the issue is about the cursor not changing to a pointer when hovering over the sorting icons, the function 'renderSort' is directly relevant because it creates the HTML elements for these icons. Adding a style attribute or ensuring the CSS class applied to these icons includes 'cursor:pointer' would likely resolve the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is related to a missing cursor:pointer style for the sorting icon in a table component. When the user hovers over the sorting icon, it does not change the cursor to a pointer, which indicates that the element is clickable. This is observed on the example provided on the official website."

            "src/table/base/sort.jsx//renderSort"
        ],
        "explanation": "The identified class and function are directly responsible for rendering the sorting functionality in the table component. The `Sort` class in 'src/table/base/sort.jsx' includes the `renderSort` function, which generates the sorting icons. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to apply the 'cursor: pointer' style to the icons or the surrounding clickable element. This will address the bug report's issue of the missing pointer cursor on the sorting buttons.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that the sorting icons on a table component do not have a 'cursor: pointer' style when hovered over. This style is typically used to indicate that an element is interactive, such as a button or link. The issue is identified in the example on the official website, where the sorting buttons lack the pointer cursor, which can confuse users about the interactivity of the icons."
