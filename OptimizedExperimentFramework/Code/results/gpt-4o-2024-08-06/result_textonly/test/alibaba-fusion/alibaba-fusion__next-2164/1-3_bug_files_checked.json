        "explanation": "The bug is related to a visual and interactive element of the Table component, which likely involves styling and possibly JavaScript logic to toggle the cursor style. The relevant files include:\n\n- **src/table/base/sort.jsx**: This file is likely responsible for the functionality and rendering of the sorting feature in the Table component.\n- **src/table/main.scss**: This file most likely contains style definitions, including cursor styles, for the Table component. The absence of `cursor: pointer` on the sort icon can be addressed here.\n- **src/table/index.jsx**: This file would typically serve as the entry point for the Table component, where styles are imported, and overall component behavior is defined. Any adjustments needed to ensure imported styles affect the sort icons would be managed here.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with the Table component, specifically related to the cursor style (cursor: pointer) not being applied to the sorting icon button. The image shows that when hovering over the sort icon, the cursor remains in its default state, which doesn't indicate that the icon is clickable."

            "src/table/base/header.jsx",
            "src/table/scss/variable.scss"
        ],
        "explanation": "1. **src/table/base/header.jsx**: This file is likely related to the table component's header, where the sorting functionality is implemented. Modifications in this file might be needed to add the appropriate CSS class or directly apply inline style changes to the sorting icons.\n\n2. **src/table/scss/variable.scss**: This file potentially contains the styles or variables related to the table components. Adding or ensuring the presence of the style cursor: pointer for the sorting icons would be crucial here to provide the visual feedback needed on hover.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the table component in the application, specifically the missing cursor: pointer style on the sorting icon in the table when hovering over it. This visual indicator (pointer cursor) is important for usability as it signals to the user that the icon is interactive and clickable."
