    "1/1": "To address the bug reported, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Bug Scenario and Root Cause Analysis:**\n   - The bug report indicates that the sorting icon in a table component does not change the cursor to a pointer when hovered over. This is a common UI/UX issue where interactive elements should indicate their interactivity by changing the cursor to a pointer.\n   - The provided image link suggests that the sorting icons are not visually indicating their interactivity, which can confuse users.\n   - The root cause is likely that the CSS for the sorting icons does not include `cursor: pointer;`, which is necessary to change the cursor style when hovering over the icons.\n\n2. **Bug Location Analysis:**\n   - The relevant code snippet is in the file `src/table/base/sort.jsx`.\n   - The `renderSort` method is responsible for rendering the sorting icons. The icons are wrapped in `<a>` tags, which are interactive elements.\n   - The `className` for these icons is dynamically set based on the sorting status, but there is no explicit style for the cursor.\n\n3. **Generate Patches:**\n   - We need to add `cursor: pointer;` to the style of the sorting icons to ensure they indicate interactivity.\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/table/base/sort.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                >\n=======\n                    style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}\n                >\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds an inline style to the `<a>` elements that represent the sorting icons, ensuring that the cursor changes to a pointer when hovered over. This change will improve the user experience by clearly indicating that the icons are clickable."
