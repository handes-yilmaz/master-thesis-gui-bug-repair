        "explanation": "The file 'src/table/base/sort.jsx' is responsible for rendering the sorting icons and handling the sorting logic. The lack of a cursor pointer when hovering over the sorting icons suggests that the issue lies in the styling or event handling within this component. The file 'src/table/main.scss' is likely responsible for the styling of the table components, including the cursor property. Adding 'cursor: pointer' to the appropriate class in this stylesheet would resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a table component where the sorting button does not display a cursor pointer when hovered over, as seen in the provided image from the official example."
