        "explanation": "The files related to the CascaderSelect component are directly involved in rendering and styling the component. The bug is related to background color anomalies during virtual scrolling, which suggests potential issues in the component's visualization or styling logic. The file \"components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx\" likely contains the logic for implementing the CascaderSelect component, including virtual scrolling. \"components/cascader-select/main.scss\" would define the component's styles, including background colors. \"components/cascader-select/style.ts\" is likely associated with handling the styling properties dynamically or exporting styles for usage elsewhere. Tests within \"components/cascader-select/__tests__/index-spec.tsx\" could provide additional context or coverage for this anomaly in tests, potentially requiring updates or verification post-fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the CascaderSelect component where the background color appears abnormal when using virtual scrolling. An image attached to the report showcases the CascaderSelect component with a potentially incorrect or unexpected background color, which may not match the intended design specifications or user expectations when interacting with virtual scrolling functionality."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the CascaderSelect component, so files related to this component are highly relevant to the bug. The 'cascader-select.tsx' file likely contains the JSX/Typescript logic and rendering details for the component, which may need adjustments to handle the virtual scrolling correctly. The 'main.scss' file contains the styles for this component, which is directly related to the background and other styling issues. The 'style.ts' file may further define or export styling modules and is relevant if the styling needs to be adjusted or augmented to fix the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is related to the CascaderSelect component in a UI library. When using virtual scrolling in the CascaderSelect component, an incorrect background color is appearing, as illustrated in the provided image. The issue specifically pertains to the visual styling not rendering as expected, which may affect the usability and aesthetic of the component."
