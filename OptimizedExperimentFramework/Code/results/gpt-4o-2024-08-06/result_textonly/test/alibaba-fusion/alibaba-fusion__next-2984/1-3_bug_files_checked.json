        "explanation": "The issue is with the CascaderSelect component, so the files related to this component are considered suspicious. In the repository structure, the `cascader-select.jsx` and `index.jsx` within the `src/cascader-select/` directory are likely the files handling the core logic of the CascaderSelect component. These files may contain the logic where input properties are improperly modified. To fix the issue, we need to inspect and possibly refactor the logic in these files to ensure that input properties remain unaltered.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the CascaderSelect component where there is an issue with the modification of input properties when using the Immer library. The component should not modify the user's input values, which leads to an error when using Immer for immutability management."

            "src/cascader-select/cascader-select.jsx"
        ],
        "explanation": "The CascaderSelect issue likely resides in the \"cascader-select.jsx\" file located in the \"src/cascader-select/\" directory. This specific file is responsible for defining the behavior and properties of the CascaderSelect component. Since the bug report mentions that the component changes the incoming properties leading to errors with Immer, the problem is almost certainly within the component's implementation code found in this file. This code likely contains the part where the properties of the component are being handled improperly, such as being directly mutated.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug reported is related to the CascaderSelect component in a JavaScript/React project where it modifies the properties passed to it, causing an error when used with the Immer library. This issue arises because the component should not alter the user's input values directly, which is significant because Immer relies on immutability."
