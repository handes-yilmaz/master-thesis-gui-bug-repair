        "explanation": "Given the nature of the issue, the bug is likely within the Tree component's event handling or state management, specifically in managing node selection states. The 'tree-node.jsx' file is responsible for individual tree nodes, which include the selection toggle logic. The 'tree.jsx' file likely manages the overall tree structure and state propagation. Finally, 'util.js' within the tree directory may contain utility functions relevant for state handling or event processing that could impact the toggle logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug in the Tree component involves the selection state not toggling correctly upon user interaction. When a node is selected and then clicked, the 'selected' parameter changes to false upon the first click, but subsequent clicks do not change this state, nor does the visual style toggle between selected and unselected."

            "src/tree/index.jsx"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug report concerns the selection state of tree nodes, specifically about toggling selection states (true to false and vice versa). These files are directly related to the Tree component's rendering and logic: \n1. **src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx**: Likely contains the logic and rendering for each node in the tree, where the selection state should be managed and toggled.\n2. **src/tree/view/tree.jsx**: This might contain high-level component logic for the Tree component, including managing overall state changes and interactions.\n3. **src/tree/view/util.js**: Typically includes utility functions, possibly including state management or toggling functions relevant to this issue.\n4. **src/tree/index.jsx**: Acts as an entry point for the Tree component; might include initialization logic or props related to selection handling. \nThese files would likely need examination to ensure the selection state toggles correctly and the visual states reflect the changes accurately.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Tree component. When interacting with a tree structure, a parameter 'selected' within 'extra' toggles state unexpectedly. Initially, on first click, the state changes to false. Subsequent clicks do not alter the state, nor do they trigger any style changes to visualize the selection state, making it impossible to discern between true and false states visually."
