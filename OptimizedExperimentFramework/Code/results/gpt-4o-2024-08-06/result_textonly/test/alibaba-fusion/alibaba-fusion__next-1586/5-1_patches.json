    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that the `selected` state of a tree node toggles correctly between `true` and `false` upon each click. The issue seems to be that once a node is clicked and its `selected` state changes to `false`, it does not toggle back to `true` on subsequent clicks. This indicates a problem with the state management or event handling related to the `selected` property.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe images provided in the bug report illustrate the tree component with nodes that should toggle their selection state when clicked. However, the current behavior is that the `selected` state changes to `false` after the first click and does not toggle back to `true` on subsequent clicks. This suggests that the event handling for toggling the `selected` state is not functioning as expected.\n\n### Bug Localization\nThe issue is likely within the `handleSelect` method in the `TreeNode` component, which is responsible for toggling the `selected` state. The method should correctly toggle the `selected` state and update the component's appearance accordingly.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n```javascript\n### src/tree/view/tree-node.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    handleSelect(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n\n        const { root, selected, eventKey } = this.props;\n        root.handleSelect(!selected, eventKey, this, e);\n    }\n=======\n    handleSelect(e) {\n        e.preventDefault();\n\n        const { root, selected, eventKey } = this.props;\n        const newSelectedState = !selected;\n        root.handleSelect(newSelectedState, eventKey, this, e);\n        this.setState({ selected: newSelectedState });\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Bug Location**: The `handleSelect` method in `TreeNode` component.\n- **Root Cause**: The `selected` state is not being toggled correctly due to improper state management.\n- **Patch**: The patch ensures that the `selected` state is toggled and updated in the component's state. This change will allow the `selected` state to toggle between `true` and `false` on each click, as expected. The `setState` call ensures that the component re-renders with the updated `selected` state, which should also update the CSS styles accordingly."
