        "explanation": "The classes 'TreeNode' and 'Tree' are directly related to the tree component described in the bug report. 'TreeNode' manages individual nodes within the tree, and it likely handles the state changes for selection and deselection, which are not functioning as expected. 'Tree', as the overarching class, probably contains the logic for managing the states of the entire tree and its nodes. Given that the issue is with toggling the selected state of a node, these classes are the most relevant elements to investigate and modify to address the bug. The problem may lie within the event handling or state management logic within these classes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a tree component where nodes are selected and deselected. When a node is clicked for the first time, the 'selected' parameter in the extra data changes to false, but subsequent clicks do not toggle this value. The visual style also does not change, making it impossible to distinguish between true or false states. The expected behavior is that the node should toggle between true and false states upon each click, with the CSS style reflecting these changes."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the selection state of tree nodes, which is a core functionality of the Tree component. In the compressed bug files, the 'TreeNode' class in 'tree-node.jsx' seems to be responsible for individual node behavior, including selection. The 'Tree' class in 'tree.jsx' likely manages the overall tree structure and provides the context for node selection. The issue described in the bug report involves the selection state not toggling correctly and the CSS not updating, which suggests that the logic for managing the 'selected' state and updating styles is likely implemented (or should be implemented) within these classes. These classes are directly related to the bug because they define the structure and behavior of the tree and its nodes, where the selection toggling problem occurs.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a Tree component where nodes have a 'selected' parameter within the 'extra' property. When a node is clicked for the first time, the 'selected' value switches to false, but subsequent clicks fail to toggle the value back to true, and the CSS style also remains unchanged, making it impossible to discern whether the node is selected or not. The expected behavior is for the node to toggle between true and false with each click, and the CSS style should correspondingly update to reflect the current selection state."
