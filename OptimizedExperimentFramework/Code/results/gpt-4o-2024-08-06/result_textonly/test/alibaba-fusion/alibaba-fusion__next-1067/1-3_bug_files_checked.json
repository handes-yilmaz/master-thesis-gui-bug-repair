        "explanation": "The files listed are related to the slider component as defined in the repository structure. The issue described in the bug report involves the functional behavior of the slider arrows and conditions related to slide indexing and infinite scrolling.\\n\\n- **src/slider/index.jsx** and **src/slider/slider.jsx** likely contain the main component logic, where properties like 'slidesToShow', 'defaultActiveIndex', and infinite scrolling are being managed or passed to subcomponents.\\n\\n- **src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx** is responsible for rendering and handling the behavior of the navigation arrows which are not functioning as expected (e.g., disabling the left arrow).\\n\\n- **src/slider/slick/helpers.js** and **src/slider/slick/event-handlers.js** potentially include utility functions and event listeners that manage slider navigation logic, including the conditions under which arrows are enabled or disabled. These files would be crucial to investigate and modify to address the faulty behavior of the arrow buttons. ",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report outlines an issue with a slider component in a JavaScript library. The specific problem is that when the 'slidesToShow' property is greater than 'slidesCount', infinite scrolling is set to false, and the 'defaultActiveIndex' is not zero, the left arrow is disabled, preventing users from navigating to previous slides. This issue is likely visible on a webpage where the slider is used, and users attempting to click the left arrow find it non-functional."

        "explanation": "The files are related to the Slider component and its navigation functionality. The `src/slider/index.jsx`, `src/slider/slider.jsx`, and `src/slider/slick/inner-slider.jsx` likely contain the main logic for rendering the slider and handling its properties. The `src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx` file might manage the rendering and functionality of the navigation arrows, which is directly related to the bug where the left arrow seems disabled by mistake. Lastly, `src/slider/slick/helpers.js` might include utility functions that determine the state and behavior of the slider controls, making it relevant for reviewing how the conditions for enabling/disabling the arrows are being managed.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided bug scenario image, users of the Slider component are affected when the number of slides set to show is greater than the slide count and the 'infinite' property is set to false. Additionally, if the 'defaultActiveIndex' is not 0, the left arrow button is disabled, which causes a poor user experience as the users are unable to navigate back in the slides as expected."
