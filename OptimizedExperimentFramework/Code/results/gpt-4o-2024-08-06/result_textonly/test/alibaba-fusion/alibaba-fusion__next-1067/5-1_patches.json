    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that when `slidesToShow` is greater than `slidesCount`, `infinite` is set to `false`, and `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`, the left arrow is disabled. This suggests that the logic for enabling/disabling the arrows is not correctly handling this specific scenario.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **Arrow Disabling Logic**: The logic for disabling the arrows is located in the `Arrow` component, specifically in the `isDisabled` static method. The method checks various conditions to determine if an arrow should be disabled.\n\n2. **Condition for Disabling Arrows**: The condition `if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) { return true; }` in the `isDisabled` method is likely causing the issue. This condition disables the arrows when the number of slides is less than or equal to the number of slides to show, which is not appropriate when `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `isDisabled` method to account for the `defaultActiveIndex` when determining if the arrows should be disabled.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) {\n            return true;\n        }\n=======\n        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow && currentSlide === 0) {\n            return true;\n        }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Logic**: The original logic disables the arrows if the total number of slides is less than or equal to the number of slides to show, without considering the current slide index.\n- **Updated Logic**: The updated logic adds a condition to check if the `currentSlide` is `0`. This ensures that the arrows are only disabled when the slider is at the start and there are not enough slides to scroll through, which aligns with the expected behavior when `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that the left arrow is not disabled when `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`, even if `slidesToShow` is greater than `slidesCount`."
