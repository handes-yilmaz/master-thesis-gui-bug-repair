        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to how the Group and SubMenu components handle their children. In 'src/menu/view/group.jsx', the Group component maps over its children and clones them, which is where the misinterpretation of spaces as multiple children could occur. Similarly, in 'src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx', the SubMenu component also deals with children elements and their rendering, which could contribute to the problem if spaces are not handled correctly. These files are key because they directly manage the structure and rendering of menu items, which is where the bug manifests.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a menu component where the Group/SubMenu is incorrectly recognizing spaces as multiple children, leading to an error. The provided image likely shows a visual representation of the menu structure, highlighting the issue with how spaces are being interpreted within the menu hierarchy."
