        "explanation": "The reported problem is related to the Menu component's inability to correctly handle spaces in Group/SubMenu items. This suggests a potential issue in how these components are rendered or how they handle their children elements.\\n\\n1. **src/menu/view/group.jsx** and **src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx**: These files are most likely responsible for rendering the Group and SubMenu components. Any issues in these files related to handling children or parsing the names could lead to the reported problem.\\n\\n2. **src/menu/view/util.js**: Utility functions used within the Menu component might be incorrectly parsing or handling whitespace within menu item names, leading to the creation of unintended additional children.\\n\\n3. **src/menu/index.jsx**: This is typically the main entry point for the Menu component, orchestrating the included files and potentially managing the logic behind how menus are displayed or parsed.",

        "explanation": "The problem is related to how the Menu component interprets spaces as multiple children. This issue affects how groups and submenus are rendered. Therefore, it is crucial to examine and potentially modify the core files that handle group and submenu rendering logic. Based on the repository structure, the files that are directly involved in the rendering and utility functions of the menu component include `group.jsx` and `sub-menu.jsx`, which are responsible for specific group and submenu functionalities, as well as `menu.jsx`, which probably manages the general structure and behavior of the menu. Additionally, `util.js` may contain helper functions that affect the construction and interpretation of these menu elements, and could be the root of the issue by incorrectly processing strings or children arrays.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that there is an issue with the Menu component where spaces within a group or submenu are being misinterpreted as multiple children, which leads to an error. The attached image, although not visible here, would likely show the visual representation of this bug, showcasing the UI malfunction caused by the incorrect space handling in the Menu component."
