    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that spaces in the Group/SubMenu are being recognized as multiple children, which leads to an error. This suggests that the code is not handling whitespace correctly when processing children elements.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\nThe issue likely arises from the way the `children` prop is being processed. In React, `children` can include text nodes, which may consist of whitespace. If the code is not filtering out or handling these text nodes properly, it could lead to the error described.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe problem is likely in the way `children` are being mapped or processed in the `Group` and `SubMenu` components. We need to ensure that only valid React elements are processed, and any text nodes (such as whitespace) are ignored.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n#### Patch for `src/menu/view/group.jsx`\nWe need to filter out any non-element children before mapping over them.\n\n```javascript\n### src/menu/view/group.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        const newChildren = children.map(child => {\n=======\n        const newChildren = React.Children.toArray(children).filter(React.isValidElement).map(child => {\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n#### Patch for `src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx`\nSimilarly, we need to ensure that only valid elements are passed to `passParentToChildren`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/menu/view/sub-menu.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return Children.map(children, child => {\n=======\n        return Children.toArray(children).filter(React.isValidElement).map(child => {\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese patches ensure that only valid React elements are processed, which should prevent the error caused by whitespace being treated as multiple children."
