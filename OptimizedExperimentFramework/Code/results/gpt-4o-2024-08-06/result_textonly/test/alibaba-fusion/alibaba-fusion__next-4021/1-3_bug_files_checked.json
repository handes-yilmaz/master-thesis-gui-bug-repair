        "explanation": "The files identified are part of the implementation of the `NumberPicker` component. The `number-picker.jsx` likely contains the core logic for handling the value changes and constraints like maximum value enforcement. The `index.jsx` serves as an entry point for the component logic, potentially managing props and state relevant to the maximum value feature. The `style.js` file might involve any style changes needed to reflect the disabled state when the maximum is reached or provide visual cues. Finally, the `mobile/index.jsx` is included as the observed issue might also affect the mobile version, suggesting responsive or adaptive logic might require adjustments.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario describes an issue with the `NumberPicker` component. The expectation is that when the maximum value is reached, the component should not allow further input. However, currently, when the value exceeds the maximum, the `onChange` event is not triggered, and an automatic correction is done on `onBlur`. This results in a situation where the user sees the value increasing, but the price remains unchanged."

            "src/number-picker/style.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the NumberPicker component, so the files that are likely involved include:\\n1. src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx: This file is likely the main implementation file for the NumberPicker component where the input logic and events such as onChange and onBlur would be handled. Adjustments here would be necessary to ensure the max value logic is enforced upon manual input.\\n2. src/number-picker/index.jsx: This file is generally the entry point for the component and may include initialization or top-level component logic related to the NumberPicker.\\n3. src/number-picker/style.js: Although not directly related to the bug logic, changes to how maximum values are reflected in the UI might require adjustments or additions in styles, making it relevant if UI feedback is adjusted as part of the fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a problem with the NumberPicker component where the expectation is that it should not allow manual input to exceed the maximum value limit. The current behavior is that exceeding the limit does not trigger an onChange event; instead, an automatic correction occurs onBlur, which causes an inconsistent user experience where the displayed data increases but the price does not change."
