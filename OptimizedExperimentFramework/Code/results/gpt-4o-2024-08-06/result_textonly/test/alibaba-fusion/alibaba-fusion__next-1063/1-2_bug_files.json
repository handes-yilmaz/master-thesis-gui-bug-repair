        "explanation": "The issue is centered on the 'Field' component as it cannot modify incoming data. In the repository structure, under the 'src/field/' directory, the main files are 'index.js' and 'utils.js'. The file 'index.js' is the entry point and most likely contains the core logic of the 'Field' component and how it processes data. The 'utils.js' file may contain utility functions used by 'index.js', possibly for data manipulation or state management. These are the primary files that need to be investigated and potentially edited to fix the bug, as they directly relate to the component exhibiting the issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue where the 'Field' component is unable to modify the passed-in data. This suggests that the 'Field' component fails to apply changes or updates to the data it receives, which might be due to how the data is handled within the component or passed between functions."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the Field component, which is specifically mentioned in the bug report. The file `src/field/index.js` is the main entry point for the Field component logic, and it is likely to contain the code responsible for handling data updates and state management. Additionally, `src/field/utils.js` might contain utility functions used by the Field component for handling data or state, especially if there are helper functions that interact with the data binding. These files are directly related to the functionality of the Field component and would need to be analyzed and potentially edited to address the reported issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with a field component where the data passed to it cannot be altered. This potentially means that the field is not rendering changes or updates correctly when data is modified, indicating a possible state management or data binding problem within the component."
