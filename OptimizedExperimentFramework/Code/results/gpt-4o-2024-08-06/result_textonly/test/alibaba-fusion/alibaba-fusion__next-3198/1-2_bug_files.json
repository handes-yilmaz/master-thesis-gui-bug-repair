        "explanation": "The file 'src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx' is responsible for the DatePicker2's time panel UI, where the 'defaultValue' is being used. Any logic related to setting or parsing the time default value is likely within this component. Additionally, 'src/date-picker2/util.js' might contain utility functions related to date parsing or formatting that could be involved in the 'Invalid Date' issue. Both files are likely involved in handling the default value and ensuring it is correctly parsed and displayed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The reported bug occurs in the DatePicker2 component when the 'timePanelProps.defaultValue' is set; the component displays 'Invalid Date' instead of the expected default time value. It is likely caused by an incorrect handling of default values or incorrect formatting/parsing of the date string."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the `DatePicker2` component, which indicates that the bug could originate in files that handle date logic and the rendering of the time panel within this specific component. \n\n1. `index.jsx` is likely the main file for `DatePicker2` where the component is defined and high-level logic is implemented, including prop handling such as `timePanelProps.defaultValue`.\n\n2. `panels/time-panel.jsx` because this file would directly relate to how the time panel is configured and displayed, where `timePanelProps` might be utilized.\n\n3. `util.js` might contain utility functions related to date manipulation and validation which could influence the display of invalid dates.\n\n4. `constant.js` might store the default value configurations or constants used throughout the component, affecting how dates are parsed and displayed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The `DatePicker2` component in the project displays \"Invalid Date\" when the `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is set. This suggests that there is an issue with how the default value is being handled or interpreted within the component's implementation."
