        "explanation": "The 'TimePanel' class in 'src/date-picker2/panels/time-panel.jsx' is directly involved in the rendering and formatting of time values based on 'timePanelProps'. It uses 'timePanelProps.defaultValue' which is implicated in the bug. The 'formater' method within this class formats the value, and if incorrectly formatted, could lead to an 'Invalid Date'. Additionally, 'setTime' function in 'src/date-picker2/util.js' is a utility used to set time values. Incorrect handling or assumptions in this function could lead to incorrect date/time values being set, contributing to the 'Invalid Date' display. These elements are critical in processing and displaying date values, making them central to the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'DatePicker2' component where setting 'timePanelProps.defaultValue' results in the display of 'Invalid Date'. The image linked in the bug report likely shows a DatePicker component interface with this erroneous display, and the reason for the error is discussed in the provided CodeSandbox link."

        "explanation": "The `TimePanel` class in `time-panel.jsx` is responsible for rendering the time panel, including formatting and displaying the time. The `formater` function within this class formats the time value, which is crucial in ensuring the correct display of a date. Any issues with formatting could lead to displaying 'Invalid Date'. The `getShow` method determines which time units (hour, minute, second) should be displayed based on the format, which could affect the default value. The `setTime` function in `util.js` is responsible for setting the time components from a source value to a target value. If `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is not correctly handled here, it could result in the display of 'Invalid Date'. These elements are likely involved in the processing of the `timePanelProps.defaultValue` and are thus key to resolving the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that when the `timePanelProps.defaultValue` is set for the `DatePicker2` component, it displays 'Invalid Date'. The issue seems to be related to how the default time value is processed and displayed within the time panel of the date picker."
