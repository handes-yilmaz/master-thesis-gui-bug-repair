        "explanation": "1. **src/transfer/view/transfer-panel.jsx**: This file contains the implementation of the TransferPanel component, which includes the search functionality. The prop `searchProps` is used here, and it is crucial to modify this file to support separate control of the search boxes for the left and right panels.\n\n2. **src/transfer/view/transfer.jsx**: This file is the main Transfer component that uses the TransferPanel. It is likely responsible for passing down the `searchProps` to the TransferPanel. Changes might be needed here to ensure that the `searchProps` are correctly split and passed to the respective panels for separate control.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the Transfer component, where the searchProps should support controlling the two search boxes on the left and right separately. The image provided in the bug report likely shows the Transfer component with two search boxes, indicating the need for separate control over each."
