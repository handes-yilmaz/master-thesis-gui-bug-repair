        "explanation": "The `TransferPanel` class in `transfer-panel.jsx` is directly responsible for rendering each panel of the Transfer component, including the search functionality. The `handleSearch` function is involved in managing the search input changes, which is crucial when implementing separate control settings for the two search boxes. Meanwhile, the `renderSearch` function is responsible for rendering the search input itself, and changes in the search properties would require modifications in this function to accommodate different configurations for each panel. Therefore, these classes and functions are directly related to the bug scenario as they need to be adapted to support the distinct search properties for each side.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a Transfer component where the requirement is to support separate control settings for the two search boxes located on the left and right sides of the interface, as shown in the provided image."

            "src/transfer/view/transfer-panel.jsx//renderSearch"
        ],
        "explanation": "The 'TransferPanel' class in 'src/transfer/view/transfer-panel.jsx' is directly responsible for rendering and managing the state of the panels within the 'Transfer' component, including the search functionality. The 'renderSearch' function is specifically responsible for rendering the search box within each panel. Given that the bug is about controlling the search properties individually for the two search boxes, these elements are key to implementing the required feature. Modifying 'TransferPanel' and 'renderSearch' would allow the developer to add functionality to pass separate 'searchProps' for each search box, thereby addressing the problem stated in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Transfer' component, specifically the support for searchProps to control two search boxes independently on either side of the component. The image linked in the bug report likely shows the current state of the transfer component where the search boxes are not independently configurable, leading to the need for this feature enhancement."
