    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to modify the `TransferPanel` component to support separate `searchProps` for the left and right search boxes. This involves updating the component to handle different `searchProps` based on the `position` prop.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe image in the bug report shows a UI component with two search boxes, one on the left and one on the right. The requirement is to allow different configurations for each search box, which is currently not supported. The root cause of the bug is that the `searchProps` are applied uniformly to both search boxes without considering their positions.\n\n### Bug Localization and Patch Generation\nThe bug is located in the `renderSearch` method of the `TransferPanel` component. We need to modify this method to apply different `searchProps` based on the `position` prop.\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/transfer/view/transfer-panel.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    renderSearch() {\n        const { prefix, searchPlaceholder, locale, searchProps = {} } = this.props;\n        return (\n            <Search\n                aria-labelledby={this.headerId}\n                shape=\"simple\"\n                {...searchProps}\n                className={`${prefix}transfer-panel-search`}\n                placeholder={searchPlaceholder || locale.searchPlaceholder}\n                onChange={this.handleSearch}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n=======\n    renderSearch() {\n        const { prefix, searchPlaceholder, locale, searchProps = {}, position } = this.props;\n        const positionSpecificSearchProps = searchProps[position] || {};\n        return (\n            <Search\n                aria-labelledby={this.headerId}\n                shape=\"simple\"\n                {...positionSpecificSearchProps}\n                className={`${prefix}transfer-panel-search`}\n                placeholder={searchPlaceholder || locale.searchPlaceholder}\n                onChange={this.handleSearch}\n            />\n        );\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Modification**: The `renderSearch` method is updated to destructure `position` from `this.props` and to use `searchProps[position]` to get position-specific search properties.\n- **Fallback**: If no specific `searchProps` are provided for a position, it defaults to an empty object.\n- **Result**: This change allows the `TransferPanel` component to apply different `searchProps` to the left and right search boxes, as required by the bug report."
