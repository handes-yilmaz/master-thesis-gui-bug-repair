        "explanation": "The bug report indicates that the problem lies in the detection of changes to the maximum and minimum values of the NumberPicker component. The compressed bug file 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx' contains the class 'NumberPicker', which is responsible for rendering and managing the state of the NumberPicker component, including handling its minimum and maximum values. Although specific functions related to this issue are not outlined in the compressed format, the class itself is the primary structure where these values would be managed, making it the key area to investigate and modify for fixing the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a problem with the NumberPicker component where changes to its maximum and minimum values are not being detected in real-time. This issue is demonstrated in the provided reproduction link and supported by an image showing the NumberPicker component where the expected behavior of updating the values is not occurring."

        "explanation": "The main file of interest is 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx', which contains the NumberPicker component. This file is highly likely to manage the state and behavior of the NumberPicker, including its maximum and minimum value properties. The bug report specifically mentions that changes to these properties are not detected in real-time, indicating that the logic responsible for handling these changes is flawed or missing in this class. The functions within this class that handle state updates and rendering are the key areas to investigate for the bug. However, based on the provided compressed format, specific function names are not visible, so the entire class is marked as likely containing the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is related to the NumberPicker component, where changes to the maximum and minimum values are not detected in real-time. Users expect that when they update these values, the component should immediately reflect the changes, but currently, it does not."
