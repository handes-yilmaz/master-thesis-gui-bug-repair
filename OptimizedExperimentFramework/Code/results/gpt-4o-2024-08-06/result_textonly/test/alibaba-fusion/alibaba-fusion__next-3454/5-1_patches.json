    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that changes to the `max` and `min` properties of the `NumberPicker` component are detected and handled in real-time. The bug report indicates that the component does not currently detect changes to these properties dynamically, which can lead to incorrect behavior when the boundaries are updated.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario image and description suggest that when the `max` or `min` values are changed, the component does not update its internal state to reflect these new boundaries. This can result in the component allowing values outside the intended range, as the boundary checks are not updated.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely that the component's state is not being updated when the `max` or `min` props change. The `getDerivedStateFromProps` lifecycle method is responsible for updating the component's state based on changes to props, but it seems that it does not handle changes to `max` and `min` correctly.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method. We need to ensure that changes to `max` and `min` are detected and the state is updated accordingly.\n\n### Patch\nWe will modify the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method to update the `max` and `min` values in the state whenever they change.\n\n```javascript\n### src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if ('value' in nextProps && `${nextProps.value}` !== `${prevState.value}`) {\n            let { value, max, min, stringMode } = nextProps;\n            value = value === undefined || value === null ? '' : stringMode ? `${value}` : value;\n            return {\n                value,\n                displayValue: value,\n                max: max !== MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? max : prevState.max,\n                min: min !== MIN_SAFE_INTEGER ? min : prevState.min,\n            };\n        }\n=======\n        let { value, max, min, stringMode } = nextProps;\n        value = value === undefined || value === null ?
