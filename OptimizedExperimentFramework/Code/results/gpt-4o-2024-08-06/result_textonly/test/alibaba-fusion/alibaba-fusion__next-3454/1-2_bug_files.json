        "explanation": "The issue lies within the NumberPicker component; therefore, the files directly related to this component are likely responsible for handling the min and max value updates. In the repository structure, the files 'number-picker.jsx' and 'index.jsx' are located within the 'number-picker' directory under 'src'. These files are likely involved in defining the component's logic, including how it handles updates to the min and max properties. Modifications in these files might be necessary to ensure real-time updates when these particular properties change.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the NumberPicker component, where changes to the minimum and maximum values are not detected in real-time as expected. The steps to reproduce and the provided image show that altering these values does not result in immediate updates to the component's behavior or display."

        "explanation": "The files related to the `NumberPicker` component are `index.jsx` and `number-picker.jsx` located within the `src/number-picker/` directory. These files are likely where the logic for value detection, rendering, and state management of the `NumberPicker` component is implemented. Given that the bug pertains to real-time detection of changes in the maximum and minimum values, these files are critical for troubleshooting and implementing a fix to ensure the component re-renders or updates appropriately when these values are modified.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the NumberPicker component, where changes to the maximum or minimum values are not detected in real time. This means that when the maximum or minimum values are updated, the NumberPicker component is not refreshing or re-rendering to reflect these changes immediately, leading to incorrect or outdated display values."
