        "explanation": "The `TextArea` class in `src/input/textarea.jsx` is directly related to the Input.TextArea component mentioned in the bug report. It handles the behavior and rendering of the TextArea component, including event handling functions like onBlur, which is likely where the type issue arises in TypeScript. The `TextAreaProps` interface in `types/input/index.d.ts` defines the TypeScript types for the properties of the TextArea component, including the onBlur event. The onBlur function in this file is specifically mentioned in the bug report, indicating a potential mismatch or incorrect type definition that needs to be addressed to solve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates a type issue with the onBlur event in TypeScript for the Input.TextArea component. The provided images, though not visible here, likely show the error messages or incorrect behavior when the onBlur event is triggered in a TypeScript environment."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the type of the onBlur event for the Input.TextArea component. In the compressed bug file 'types/input/index.d.ts', the TextArea interface extends HTMLAttributesWeak, where the onBlur function is defined. This suggests that the issue arises from the definition or expected type of the onBlur event within this interface. Therefore, the TextArea class in the 'types/input/index.d.ts' file is a key part of the bug as it directly handles the type definitions for events related to the Input.TextArea component.",
