    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The bug report mentions a problem with the `onBlur` event type in TypeScript for the `Input.TextArea` component. Let's go through the steps to identify and fix the issue.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Report and Images**: The bug report indicates an issue with the `onBlur` event type in TypeScript for the `Input.TextArea` component. The images provided in the bug report likely show the error messages or the incorrect behavior related to this event.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The root cause of the issue is likely a mismatch or incorrect type definition for the `onBlur` event in the TypeScript interface for the `TextArea` component. This can lead to TypeScript errors when using the `onBlur` event in a TypeScript environment.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nWe have two files in the bug code snippets:\n- `src/input/textarea.jsx`: This file contains the implementation of the `TextArea` component.\n- `types/input/index.d.ts`: This file contains the TypeScript type definitions for the `TextArea` component.\n\nThe issue is likely in the `types/input/index.d.ts` file, where the `onBlur` event type is defined. Let's locate and fix the issue.\n\n### Generate Patches\n\n#### Patch for `types/input/index.d.ts`\n\nThe `onBlur` event should have a type that matches the event handler signature for a `textarea` element in React. The correct type for the `onBlur` event should be `(e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void`.\n\n```javascript\n### types/input/index.d.ts\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    onBlur?: () => void;\n=======\n    onBlur?: (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Search Block**: We searched for the existing `onBlur` type definition in the `TextAreaProps` interface.\n- **Replace Block**: We replaced the existing type with the correct type signature for the `onBlur` event, which includes the event parameter `e` of type `React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`. This ensures that the `onBlur` event handler receives the correct event object when the event is triggered.\n\nThis patch should resolve the TypeScript type issue for the `onBlur` event in the `Input.TextArea` component."
