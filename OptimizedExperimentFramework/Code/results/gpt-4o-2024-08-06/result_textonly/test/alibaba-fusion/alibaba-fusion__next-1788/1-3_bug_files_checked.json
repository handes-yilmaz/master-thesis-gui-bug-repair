        "explanation": "The reason these files are related to the bug is as follows: \\n1. `src/input/textarea.jsx`: This file is highly likely to contain the implementation of the `TextArea` component of the `Input` module. To address the bug related to the `onBlur` event type, this file will need to be examined to ensure the event handler is correctly defined and implemented.\\n2. `types/input/index.d.ts`: This TypeScript definition file includes the type declarations for the `Input` components, including `TextArea`. Since the issue is specifically with TypeScript typing of the `onBlur` event, this file will need to be reviewed and possibly modified to ensure the `onBlur` event type is correctly defined for `TextArea`. These types are crucial for developers using TypeScript as they define the expected interfaces and types for components.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report refers to an issue with the TypeScript type definition for the `onBlur` event in the `Input.TextArea` component. It indicates there is a problem with how the event is typed in TypeScript, which may result in errors or incorrect type checks when using this event in the `Input` component's `TextArea` feature."

        "explanation": "- **src/input/textarea.jsx**: This file is likely related because it would contain the JSX definition for the `TextArea` component, including event handlers like `onBlur`. If there is a type issue, it might arise in how this file handles the `onBlur` event.\\n\\n- **types/input/index.d.ts**: This TypeScript definition file would define the types used by the components in the `input` directory. Since the issue is related to TypeScript types and the `onBlur` event specifically, any incorrect type definitions or absence of proper typings will be in this file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to a TypeScript type issue that occurs in the Input component's `TextArea` on the `onBlur` event. The images provided likely demonstrate the incorrect or unexpected behavior when the `onBlur` event is triggered, such as error messages or log outputs indicating a type mismatch or absence."
