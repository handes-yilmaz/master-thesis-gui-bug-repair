        "explanation": "The file `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is likely responsible for the implementation of the NumberPicker component. This component renders and handles the logic for number increment/decrement, and is where precision handling appears to fail. The bug report specifies that the issue appears during the display of results after incrementing by 0.01, which is operations that this component would perform. To fix this, the arithmetic operations within this file's logic need to properly handle precision, likely by using rounding methods to limit floating point inaccuracies. The file `src/util/string.js` might be relevant if there are utility functions related to number formatting, as these functions would need to ensure the number is displayed with the correct precision, particularly when the precision is explicitly set by the user in the NumberPicker component's props.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is that when using the NumberPicker component in Safari, adding 0.01 to 4.02 results in an incorrect display of 4.029999999999999 instead of 4.03. This is due to JavaScript's floating point precision issue, which causes unexpected results in arithmetic operations on decimal numbers, especially when precise display is expected in components like NumberPicker."

        "explanation": "The bug is directly related to the NumberPicker component, which is likely implemented within `src/number-picker/index.jsx`. This file would handle the logic of how numbers are incremented, displayed, and rounded. To fix the precision issue, developers would need to adjust how decimal additions are handled, possibly by implementing a function to manage floating-point computations correctly, which could be located here.\n\nAdditionally, `src/util/string.js` might be involved, assuming it contains utility functions for handling string conversions of numbers, which could contribute to the display error when converting the float to a string representation for rendering. Correct rounding and formatting might need to be adjusted here to ensure the displayed number matches the expected precision.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a JavaScript float precision issue in Safari where adding 0.01 to 4.02 yields 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03. This discrepancy leads to a display bug in the NumberPicker component, where rounding or display logic fails to correctly render the expected incremental value. The issue is more pronounced when a NumberPicker is initialized with default values and used to increment numbers with a certain precision but falls short in representing that precision correctly on Safari browsers."
