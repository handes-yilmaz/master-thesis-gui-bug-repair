    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that the close button in the Dialog component is positioned correctly when there is no title. The issue is that the close button overlaps with the content when the title is absent, as shown in the provided image.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\nThe problem arises because the close button is not being repositioned or styled correctly when the title is not present. The Dialog component's layout does not account for the absence of a title, leading to the close button overlapping with the content.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue is likely in the `renderCloseLink` method of the `Inner` component, where the close button is rendered. We need to adjust the styling or positioning logic to ensure that the close button is correctly placed even when the title is absent.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n```javascript\n### src/dialog/inner.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    renderCloseLink() {\n        const { prefix, closeable, onClose, locale } = this.props;\n\n        if (closeable) {\n            return (\n                <a\n                    role=\"button\"\n                    aria-label={locale.close}\n                    className={`${prefix}dialog-close`}\n                    onClick={onClose}\n                >\n                    <Icon\n                        className={`${prefix}dialog-close-icon`}\n                        type=\"close\"\n                    />\n                </a>\n            );\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n=======\n    renderCloseLink() {\n        const { prefix, closeable, onClose, locale, title } = this.props;\n\n        if (closeable) {\n            const closeLinkStyle = title ? {} : { top: '10px' }; // Adjust top position if no title\n            return (\n                <a\n                    role=\"button\"\n                    aria-label={locale.close}\n                    className={`${prefix}dialog-close`}\n                    onClick={onClose}\n                    style={closeLinkStyle}\n                >\n                    <Icon\n                        className={`${prefix}dialog-close-icon`}\n                        type=\"close\"\n                    />\n                </a>\n            );\n        }\n\n        return null;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We added a `style` attribute to the close link `<a>` element.\n- If the `title` is not present, we adjust the `top` position of the close button to ensure it does not overlap with the content.\n- This simple conditional styling ensures that the close button is correctly positioned regardless of whether the title is present."
