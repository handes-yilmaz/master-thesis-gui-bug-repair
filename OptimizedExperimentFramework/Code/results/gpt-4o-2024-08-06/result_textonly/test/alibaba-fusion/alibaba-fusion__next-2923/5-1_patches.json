    "1/1": "To address the memory leak issue in the `ConfigProvider` component during server-side rendering (SSR), we need to provide a mechanism to manually clear the cache since the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method is not called in SSR. Here's how we can fix the issue:\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**: The `ConfigProvider` component is experiencing a memory leak in SSR scenarios. The internal cache (`childContextCache`) is not being cleared because `componentWillUnmount` is not executed in SSR, as noted in the React issue [#3714](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/3714).\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The `componentWillUnmount` method is responsible for removing the cache entry for the component instance. However, in SSR, this lifecycle method is not called, leading to the cache not being cleared and causing memory growth.\n\n3. **Solution**: Introduce a manual method to clear the cache, which can be called explicitly when needed.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe will add a static method to the `ConfigProvider` class to allow manual cache clearing. This method will be called `clearCache`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/config-provider/index.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    render() {\n        return Children.only(this.props.children);\n    }\n}\n=======\n    /**\n     * Manually clear the cache to prevent memory leaks in SSR scenarios.\n     */\n    static clearCache() {\n        childContextCache._store.clear();\n        childContextCache._root = null;\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return Children.only(this.props.children);\n    }\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **New Method**: `clearCache` is a static method added to the `ConfigProvider` class. It clears the internal cache by resetting the `_store` and `_root` properties of the `childContextCache` instance.\n- **Usage**: This method can be called manually in SSR environments to ensure that the cache is cleared and memory is not leaked.\n\nThis patch provides a way to manage the cache manually, addressing the memory leak issue in SSR scenarios."
