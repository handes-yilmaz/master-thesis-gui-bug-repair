        "explanation": "The reported bug is related to the delete functionality in the Upload component when using itemRender. The files that are likely responsible for handling the Upload component's rendering, including the item rendering and any utility functions related to handling item states, are central to addressing this issue. These include:\\n\\n1. **src/upload/index.jsx**: This is the main entry point for the Upload component and will manage the core logic and state management.\\n\\n2. **src/upload/list.jsx**: This file likely handles the rendering of the list of uploaded items, where the itemRender function would be implemented, thus relevant to managing delete functionalities.\\n\\n3. **src/upload/upload.jsx**: This file will contain logic related to the uploading process, including hooks for the functionalities such as delete.\\n\\n4. **src/upload/util.js**: Utilities for managing operations such as file operations, rendering utilities which may include delete and render helpers.\\n\\nTherefore, reviewing and potentially modifying these files will help in fixing the issue with itemRender not supporting delete functionality.",

        "explanation": "1. `src/upload/upload.jsx`: This file likely contains the implementation of the `Upload` component itself, where features like `itemRender` would be configured or invoked. It is essential to look into this file to understand how `itemRender` is set up and potentially modify it to integrate the delete functionality.\n\n2. `src/upload/util.js`: Utilities related to uploading operations might be defined here. If there are any helper functions responsible for managing uploaded items or handling features like item removal, it could be in this file.\n\n3. `src/upload/list.jsx`: This file is likely responsible for rendering the list of uploaded items. Adding or fixing the delete functionality could involve modifications in how list items are managed or rendered, including handling the event for the delete action.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the Upload component where the itemRender feature is being used. It lacks the functionality to delete an item after upload. The problem appears in the version 1.22.0 as seen in the provided image, which shows an uploaded file with an 'itemRender' but without a visible delete button for the user to remove the uploaded item."
