        "explanation": "The 'List' class in 'src/upload/list.jsx' is directly related to rendering the items in the upload component, which includes handling the display and interaction for uploaded files. The 'handleClose', 'getTextList', 'getImageList', and 'getPictureCardList' functions are responsible for handling the deletion and rendering logic of the uploaded items. Particularly, 'handleClose' is explicitly designed to manage the removal of files, which directly relates to the reported issue of lacking a delete function. The rendering functions ('getTextList', 'getImageList', 'getPictureCardList') are involved in displaying the files, and modifications here would be necessary to integrate any new UI elements or interactions, such as a delete button or link.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Upload' component in version 1.22.0, where the 'itemRender' does not support a delete function. This issue is illustrated in the provided image, which likely shows a UI element where the delete functionality is expected but absent."

        "explanation": "The List class in 'src/upload/list.jsx' is responsible for rendering the file list and handling the operations associated with each file, such as rendering the delete button and managing the deletion of files. The 'handleClose' function explicitly handles the file removal process, which is directly related to the bug since the delete functionality is missing. The functions 'getTextList', 'getImageList', and 'getPictureCardList' are responsible for rendering different types of file item lists (text, image, card) and each include logic that determines whether the delete button is rendered and functional. Therefore, any issues with the rendering or functionality of the delete button and its associated logic would likely involve these functions.",
