        "explanation": "The bug relates to clearing search results in the CascaderSelect component. The relevant files likely include logic for rendering the CascaderSelect component, handling state changes like search results, and styling. \"index.tsx\" and \"cascader-select.tsx\" probably contain the main component logic and handling for search behavior. The \"style.ts\" file handles component styling, which may need adjustments if a new button is added for clearing search results. The \"types.ts\" file may define types related to search functionality, which might require updates if new functions or props are introduced.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the CascaderSelect component not clearing its search results after a user selects all options. Users remain on the search results page even after completing their selections, leading to confusion about returning to the full list view. The desired feature is either automatic clearing of the search results or a button to manually clear the search."

            "components/cascader-select/style.ts"
        ],
        "explanation": "The problem is directly related to the functionality of the 'CascaderSelect' component, specifically related to multiple selections and search functionality. The 'cascader-select.tsx' is likely where the core logic for rendering the dropdown, managing selected items, and handling the search mechanism is implemented. 'index.tsx' may serve as the entry point for this component, where component props and state handling are configured. The 'style.ts' might be responsible for any styling changes that need to accompany the functional adjustments, like hiding or showing elements based on search state.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs in the CascaderSelect component when using multiple selection and search functionality. After the user selects all result items through search, the interface still remains on the search result page. Users may get confused about what to do next or how to return to the complete list view. The only way to return is by clicking outside the dropdown to close it and re-opening it."
