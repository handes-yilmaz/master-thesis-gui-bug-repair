        "explanation": "The files likely related to the bug are within the Rating component directory, specifically 'index.jsx' and 'rating.jsx'. These files are typically where the component logic and rendering occur. The problem description points to an issue in the event handling within the Rating component, so these files should contain the relevant code for the 'onChange' event handling that is being incorrectly resolved twice when the 'id' attribute is added.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the Rating component. When an 'id' attribute is passed to the Rating component, the 'onChange' event is triggered twice instead of once when a score is changed. This is observed by adding an 'id' attribute to the Rating component and then changing the score. The console logs show two entries for a single click action, indicating the event is being fired twice."

        "explanation": "The files likely involved in this bug are directly related to the 'Rating' component located in the 'src/rating/' directory. The following files are identified: 1. 'src/rating/index.jsx' - This is likely the entry point of the Rating component module, which might import and render the actual Rating component. 2. 'src/rating/rating.jsx' - This is likely the main implementation file of the Rating component. The logic that handles the 'onChange' event triggering resides in here or a file it uses. The issue of 'onChange' being triggered twice is likely an implementation detail within these files that handle the event logic of the Rating component when the 'id' attribute is set.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the 'Rating' component. When the 'id' attribute is passed to a Rating component and a score is toggled, the 'onChange' event is triggered twice. The issue is demonstrated in the reproduction link provided, where one click results in two log entries in the console, as depicted in the screenshot from the bug report."
