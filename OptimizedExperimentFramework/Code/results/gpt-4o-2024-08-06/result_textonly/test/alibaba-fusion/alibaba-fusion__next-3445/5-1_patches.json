    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The bug report indicates that when an `id` attribute is passed to the `Rating` component, the `onChange` event is triggered twice upon clicking to change the score. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the event handlers are set up or how the component's state is managed.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\nThe problem seems to be related to the `handleClick` method in the `Rating` component. The `handleClick` method is responsible for updating the component's state and triggering the `onChange` callback. The issue might be that the `onChange` callback is being called twice due to the way the event is handled or due to the presence of the `id` attribute, which might be causing the event to be triggered twice.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe `handleClick` method in the `Rating` component is the likely location of the bug. We need to ensure that the `onChange` callback is only called once per click event.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `handleClick` method to ensure that the `onChange` callback is only triggered once. We can achieve this by checking if the `newValue` is different from the current `value` before calling `onChange`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/rating/rating.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    handleClick(e) {\n        if (this.state.disabled) {\n            return;\n        }\n        const { allowClear } = this.props;\n        const { value } = this.state;\n        const newValue = this.getValue(e);\n        let isReset = false;\n        if (allowClear) {\n            isReset = newValue === value;\n        }\n        this.handleLeave();\n        if (newValue < 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (!('value' in this.props)) {\n            this.setState({ value: isReset ? 0 : newValue, clicked: true });\n        }\n\n        this.props.onChange(isReset ? 0 : newValue);\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.setState({ clicked: false });\n        }, 100);\n        this.setState({\n            cleanedValue: isReset ? newValue : null,\n        });\n    }\n=======\n    handleClick(e) {\n        if (this.state.disabled) {\n            return;\n        }\n        const { allowClear } = this.props;\n        const { value } = this.state;\n        const newValue = this.getValue(e);\n        let isReset = false;\n        if (allowClear) {\n            isReset = newValue === value;\n        }\n        this.handleLeave();\n        if (newValue < 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (!('value' in this.props)) {\n            this.setState({ value: isReset ? 0 : newValue, clicked: true });\n        }\n\n        if (newValue !== value) {\n            this.props.onChange(isReset ? 0 : newValue);\n        }\n        \n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.setState({ clicked: false });\n        }, 100);\n        this.setState({\n            cleanedValue: isReset ? newValue : null,\n        });\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The patch modifies the `handleClick` method to include a condition that checks if `newValue` is different from the current `value` before calling `this.props.onChange`.\n- This ensures that the `onChange` callback is only triggered when there is an actual change in the rating value, preventing it from being called twice when the `id` attribute is present."
