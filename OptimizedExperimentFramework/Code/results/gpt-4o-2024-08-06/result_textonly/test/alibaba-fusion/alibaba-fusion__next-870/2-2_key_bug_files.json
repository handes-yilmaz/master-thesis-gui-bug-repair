        "explanation": "1) The Overlay component's positioning issue is likely related to the files 'src/overlay/overlay.jsx', 'src/overlay/popup.jsx', and 'src/overlay/position.jsx'. These files handle the rendering and positioning logic of the overlay and popup components. The 'overlay.jsx' file is responsible for the main overlay component, 'popup.jsx' extends the overlay functionality, and 'position.jsx' manages the positioning logic, which is crucial for fixing the wrong position bug when scrollbars are involved. 2) The NumberPicker style issue is related to 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx', which contains the logic for rendering the NumberPicker component and handling its styles. The incorrect 'innerBefore' style and lack of 'innerAfter' support would be addressed in this file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves two issues: 1) The Overlay component's popup appears in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars, specifically when interacting with a datepicker. The issue is observed when the datepicker is clicked, scrolled down slightly, and then clicked again, causing the popup to appear in an incorrect location. 2) The NumberPicker component has a style issue where the 'innerBefore' style is incorrect and does not support 'innerAfter'."
