        "explanation": "The issue is related to the 'Tab' component's interaction and behavior when handling long content. The following files are likely relevant:\n\n1. **src/tab/index.jsx**: This is the main entry file for the Tab component, where the overall structure and export might be defined. Any changes to the default behavior of tabs will likely start here.\n\n2. **src/tab/tabs/content.jsx**: The content file will handle the display of tabbed content. The scrolling issue might be due to the lack of a scrollable container or an overflow handling property in styling.\n\n3. **src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx**: This file might be responsible for the navigation aspect of the tabs, possibly handling how tabs are displayed and interacted with (left-right navigation in case of overflow might need to be implemented or enhanced here).\n\n4. **src/tab/tab.jsx**: As a likely core file of the tab component, it may contain logic related to tab interaction, selection, and state management that could affect scrolling or dragging functionalities.\n\nThese files need to be examined and potentially modified to implement or fix the scrolling or dragging feature for content-overflow scenarios in tab components.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the application, the 'Tab' component does not allow for scrolling when the content is too long, causing inconvenience to users. The user suggests adding the ability for the tabs to be draggable or to scroll using the keyboard when the tab content exceeds the visible area."

        "explanation": "From the repo structure, the files related to the Tab component are located in the 'src/tab/' directory. These files potentially manage the rendering and styling of tab contents. Modifying 'index.jsx', 'tab.jsx', 'content.jsx', and 'nav.jsx' would allow developers to introduce scrollbar functionality or improve navigation within tabs.\n\n- 'index.jsx' is likely the entry point for the Tab component, where overarching component logic is implemented.\n- 'content.jsx' probably manages how tab content is displayed, which is directly related to the scrolling issue.\n- 'nav.jsx' could manage navigation elements within the tab, which might need adjustment for improved usability with longer content.\n- 'tab.jsx' handles the tab component as a whole, making it an essential file for any substantial changes.\n- 'main.scss' would contain styling information that could be adjusted to accommodate scrollbars or drag/keyboard interactions effectively.\n\nThese files are integral to rendering and managing the navigation within the Tab component, where the scrolling feature would be implemented or fixed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a usability issue with the Tab component, where long content within the tab does not allow scrolling, which makes the UI inconvenient to use. The user suggests adding drag or keyboard scrolling functionalities for navigation. An image is provided, likely showing the Tab component with content exceeding its viewable area, but without scrollbars or an intuitive way to navigate."
