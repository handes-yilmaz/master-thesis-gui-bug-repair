        "explanation": "1. **src/tab/tabs/nav.jsx**: This file is likely responsible for the navigation logic of the tabs, including handling user interactions such as clicks and potentially keyboard events. The bug report suggests a need for improved scrolling or navigation functionality, which would be implemented in this file.\n\n2. **src/tab/main.scss**: This file contains the styling for the tab component, including overflow properties and scrollbar visibility. The bug report mentions the inability to scroll, which could be due to CSS properties that hide or disable scrollbars. Adjusting these styles could resolve the issue by allowing the tab content to be scrollable.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a Tab component where the content is too long, and the tab does not allow scrolling, making it inconvenient for users. The user suggests enabling dragging or keyboard scrolling to improve usability."
