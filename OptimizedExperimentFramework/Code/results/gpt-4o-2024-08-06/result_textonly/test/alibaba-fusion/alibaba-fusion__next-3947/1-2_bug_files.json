        "explanation": "The files related to the form component are likely involved in the bug because the problem is related to the form validation mechanism and the API for displaying error messages. The file 'form.jsx' should be examined as it is the main file where the form logic and structure are implemented. Any changes to form properties, error message labels, and validation mechanisms could be addressed here. The file 'enhance.jsx' is possibly involved as it may contain enhancement logic related to form validation, which is directly related to the issue of label-based error messages. Lastly, the 'style.js' file might contain styles affecting how labels and error messages are displayed, potentially contributing to the issue with DOM structure affecting the API's functionality.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a form within which the form label is utilized as a validation message. The existing API, 'useLabelForErrorMessage', fails to work effectively when additional DOM structures are introduced during the business layer's style encapsulation. To address this issue, there is a request to introduce a new API named 'errorMessageLabel' that can be used in conjunction with 'useLabelForErrorMessage'. This is to ensure that the error messages are displayed correctly, irrespective of the added DOM layers."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the Form component, specifically dealing with how labels for error messages are managed. The src/form directory is the primary place where form components are implemented. These files are suspected to handle the overall structure and functionality of the form items, including label rendering.\\n- enhance.jsx could contain higher-order component functions that might be used to wrap form elements, thus impacting error handling.\\n- error.jsx is likely responsible for handling or displaying errors, including error messages and labels.\\n- form.jsx generally contains the logic for building and controlling form behavior, potentially where label control logic is implemented.\\n- index.jsx serves as the entry point for the form module, integrating various components and APIs, including new APIs like getLabel or errorMessageLabel.\\n- item.jsx is usually responsible for individual form items which would directly involve label handling and associated error messaging.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image attached to the Bug Report shows a part of the form component with an error message that isn't displaying as expected due to added DOM structure by styling at the business layer. This makes useLabelForErrorMessage API ineffective. The request is to create an additional API, errorMessageLabel, to ensure error labels can be applied correctly even with additional DOM wrapping."
