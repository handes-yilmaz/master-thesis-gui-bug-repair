    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that the operation buttons within the `NumberPicker` component are visible when the component is focused via the keyboard. The issue seems to be related to the focus state not being maintained correctly, and the operation buttons remaining hidden even when they should be visible.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that when the `NumberPicker` component is focused using the keyboard, the operation buttons (presumably increment and decrement buttons) should be visible. However, they remain hidden, and the focus state of the `NumberPicker` is lost. The report suggests using `:focus-within` to maintain the focus style.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to the CSS or JavaScript logic that controls the visibility of the operation buttons and the focus state of the `NumberPicker`. The component should maintain a focus state when any of its child elements (like the operation buttons) are focused, which can be achieved using the `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is likely located in the rendering logic of the `NumberPicker` component, specifically in how it handles focus and visibility of the operation buttons. We need to ensure that the component uses `:focus-within` to maintain the focus state and that the operation buttons are visible when the component is focused.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n```javascript\n### src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nrender() {\n    const {\n        device,\n        prefix,\n        rtl,\n        disabled,\n        style,\n        className,\n        size,\n        max,\n        min,\n        autoFocus,\n=======\nrender() {\n    const {\n        device,\n        prefix,\n        rtl,\n        disabled,\n        style,\n        className,\n        size,\n        max,\n        min,\n        autoFocus,\n        alwaysShowTrigger,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<div\n    className={classNames({\n        [`${prefix}number-picker`]: true,\n        [`${prefix}disabled`]: disabled,\n        [`${prefix}${size}`]: size,\n        [className]: className,\n    })}\n    style={style}\n    dir={rtl ?

This will help in maintaining the focus style using CSS.\n2. **Visibility of Buttons**: Modified the condition to show the operation buttons based on `hasTrigger` or `alwaysShowTrigger` to ensure they are visible when required.\n\nThese changes should address the issue by ensuring the focus state is maintained and the operation buttons are visible when the `NumberPicker` is focused via the keyboard."
