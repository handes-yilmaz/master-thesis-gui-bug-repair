        "explanation": "1. **src/table/base/header.jsx**: This file is responsible for rendering the table header, including the cells within it. The bug report mentions customizing header cell content, which directly relates to the functionality implemented in this file. The file contains logic for rendering header cells with sorting, filtering, and resizing capabilities, which are likely areas where customization would be applied.\n\n2. **src/table/base/cell.jsx**: This file defines the Cell component, which is used to render individual cells in the table, including header cells. Since the bug involves customizing the content of header cells, changes might be needed in how the Cell component handles rendering of custom content or interactive elements like checkboxes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the Table component where the header cell content can be customized. The provided image shows a table header with a checkbox for selecting all rows, indicating that the customization might involve adding or modifying interactive elements in the header cells."
