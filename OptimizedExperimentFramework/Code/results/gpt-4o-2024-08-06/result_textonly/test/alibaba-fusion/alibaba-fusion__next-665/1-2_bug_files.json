        "explanation": "1. **src/table/base/header.jsx**: This file likely deals with the setup and rendering of table headers. Since the bug involves customizing header cells and potentially the select-all functionality, any changes around the header logic would be found here.\n\n2. **src/table/selection/row.jsx**: This file is probably related to selection features within the table, including selecting rows. Since the bug includes a select-all issue, examining how selections are handled at the row level would be crucial.\n\n3. **src/table/util.js**: Utility functions for tables might include logic for handling selection states and interactions, affecting how select-all and other header functionalities are managed.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided bug report, the issue is related to the 'Table' component, specifically the ability to customize headers. The feature description indicates that the header cell content can be customized, but it seems there's a problem with the handling of a select-all feature in the header."

        "explanation": "The files identified are related to the Table component and its header functionality, which is where the bug or feature request is located. Specifically, the files include cell-related and header-related logic, which are necessary for implementing a custom header with a select all option. The 'cell.jsx' and 'header.jsx' files are key for handling cell rendering and header functionalities within the table, making them directly relevant to addressing the bug report. The 'index.jsx' in the table folder is often an entry point for the component, possibly aggregating exports and handling component structure, which might need adjustments supporting the custom header feature integration.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with a custom header select all cell in the Table component. There is a feature request to allow customization of the cell content in the table header, potentially including a select all option. The image provided seems to be an example of what this customization should look like."
