        "explanation": "The bug relates to customizing the content of the header cells in a table component. The `Header` class in `header.jsx` is directly responsible for rendering the table header cells, which includes the logic for handling custom cell content, sorting, filtering, and resizing. The `render` method of the `Header` class constructs the header cell elements, making it a key area to investigate for customization issues. Similarly, the `Cell` class in `cell.jsx` is responsible for rendering individual table cells, including header cells, and its `render` method handles the display logic and customization of cell content. Therefore, both the `Header` and `Cell` classes and their `render` methods are critical for resolving issues related to header cell customization.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug pertains to the table component where there is an issue with the customization of header cell content in a table. The user is attempting to implement a feature that allows customization of the header cell content, but there seems to be a problem in achieving this functionality as expected."

        "explanation": "The bug report indicates an issue with customizing the header cell content in the Table component. The `Header` class in `header.jsx` is responsible for rendering the table header, and its `render` function is directly involved in generating the content of header cells. The `getCellRef` function is also involved as it manages references to these cells. The `Cell` class in `cell.jsx` is responsible for rendering individual cells, including header cells, and its `render` function is crucial for how cells display content. Therefore, these classes and functions are relevant to the reported bug as they directly handle the rendering and customization of table header cells.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the Table component's header, where there is an issue with customizing the header cell content, possibly involving the functionality of selecting all cells."
