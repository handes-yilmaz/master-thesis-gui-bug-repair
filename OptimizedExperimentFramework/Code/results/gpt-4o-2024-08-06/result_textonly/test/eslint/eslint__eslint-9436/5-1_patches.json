    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to refine the error reporting in the `no-constant-condition` rule of ESLint. The current implementation reports the entire statement or expression containing a constant condition, but the desired behavior is to report only the constant condition itself.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe bug report indicates that the `no-constant-condition` rule in ESLint is reporting a broader range than necessary. Specifically, it highlights the entire statement or expression rather than just the constant condition. For example, in the code `if (true) { something(); }`, the error should only underline `true`, not the entire `if` statement.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause of the issue lies in how the `context.report` function is being used in the `reportIfConstant` function. The current implementation reports the entire node, which includes the whole statement or expression. To fix this, we need to adjust the reporting to focus only on the constant condition.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch\n\nThe bug is located in the `reportIfConstant` function within the `lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js` file. We need to modify the `context.report` call to specify the range of the constant condition.\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        function reportIfConstant(node) {\n            if (node.test && isConstant(node.test, true)) {\n                context.report({ node, message: \"Unexpected constant condition.\" });\n            }\n        }\n=======\n        function reportIfConstant(node) {\n            if (node.test && isConstant(node.test, true)) {\n                context.report({\n                    node,\n                    loc: node.test.loc, // Report only the location of the constant condition\n                    message: \"Unexpected constant condition.\"\n                });\n            }\n        }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Code**: The `context.report` function was reporting the entire node, which includes the whole statement or expression.\n- **Modified Code**: The `context.report` function now specifies `loc: node.test.loc`, which ensures that only the location of the constant condition (`node.test`) is reported. This change narrows the error range to just the constant condition itself, as desired.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that the error range reported by ESLint is precise and only includes the constant condition, rather than the entire statement or expression."
