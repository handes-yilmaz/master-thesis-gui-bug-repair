        "explanation": "The file `lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-analyzer.js` is likely a key bug file because it contains logic related to code path analysis, including functions that check logical operators and update code paths based on AST nodes. The bug report indicates an issue with how the code path is analyzed for the `??` operator in combination with `&&`, suggesting that the logic in this file may not correctly handle this case.\n\nThe file `lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-state.js` is also relevant because it manages the state of code path generation, including contexts for logical expressions and choices. The bug involves incorrect path analysis for a specific logical expression, which suggests that the state management for these expressions might not be handling the `??` operator correctly when combined with `&&`. This file likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to correctly represent the paths for `(a && b) ?? c`.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect code path analysis for the expression `(a && b) ?? c`. The expected behavior is that there should be a path from `a` to `c` that does not go through `b`, as demonstrated by the example `(null && console.log(\"b\")) ?? console.log(\"c\")`, which logs only \"c\". However, the current analysis incorrectly assumes a path that always goes through `b`, which is only correct for `(a || b) ?? c`."
