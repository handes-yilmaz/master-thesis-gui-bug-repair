    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, let's break down the problem and identify the root cause:\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n**Bug Description:**\nThe bug report indicates that the `no-unused-vars` rule in ESLint is not respecting the `ignoreRestSiblings` flag when used inside function arguments. This flag is supposed to suppress warnings for unused variables when using object destructuring with rest properties.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe issue likely stems from the ESLint rule implementation not correctly handling the `ignoreRestSiblings` option in the context of function arguments. This could be due to a missing or incorrect check in the rule's logic that should account for rest siblings in destructured function parameters.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nSince the Bug Code Snippets section is empty (`{}`), it indicates that there are no specific code snippets provided for this bug. This means the issue is likely within the ESLint rule implementation itself, rather than in a specific user codebase.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo fix this issue, the ESLint rule for `no-unused-vars` needs to be updated to correctly handle the `ignoreRestSiblings` option within function arguments. This would involve modifying the ESLint source code, specifically the logic that checks for unused variables in function parameters.\n\nHowever, without access to the specific ESLint source code files, I cannot provide a direct patch. Typically, this would involve:\n\n1. Locating the `no-unused-vars` rule implementation in the ESLint codebase.\n2. Modifying the logic to correctly handle rest siblings in function arguments.\n3. Adding or updating test cases to ensure the rule behaves as expected with the `ignoreRestSiblings` option.\n\nIf you have access to the ESLint source code, you would need to make these changes directly in the relevant files. If not, you may need to report this issue to the ESLint maintainers or check if a newer version of ESLint has already addressed this problem."
