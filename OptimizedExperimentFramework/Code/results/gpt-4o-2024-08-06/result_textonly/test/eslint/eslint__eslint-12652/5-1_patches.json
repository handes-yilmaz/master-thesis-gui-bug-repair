    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the ESLint rule for `key-spacing` does not incorrectly re-align objects in JSX curly braces when the `align: 'value'` option is used. The problem seems to be that the current implementation of the rule does not properly handle JSX objects, leading to undesirable formatting changes.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Root Cause Reasoning\n\nThe provided images show examples of how the `key-spacing` rule is misaligning JSX objects when the `align: 'value'` option is used. The root cause of the issue is likely that the rule does not differentiate between regular object literals and JSX objects, leading to incorrect alignment behavior.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code for the `key-spacing` rule is located in the `lib/rules/key-spacing.js` file. The function `verifyGroupAlignment` is responsible for checking the alignment of properties within an object. This function uses the `alignmentOptions` to determine how to align the properties. The issue likely arises because the function does not account for JSX objects, which should not be re-aligned.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `verifyGroupAlignment` function to skip alignment checks for JSX objects. We can do this by adding a condition to check if the object is a JSX object and, if so, bypass the alignment logic.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/key-spacing.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        function verifyGroupAlignment(properties) {\n            const length = properties.length,\n                widths = properties.map(getKeyWidth), // Width of keys, including quotes\n                align = alignmentOptions.on; // \"value\" or \"colon\"\n            let targetWidth = Math.max(...widths),\n                beforeColon, afterColon, mode;\n\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            }\n=======\n        function verifyGroupAlignment(properties) {\n            const length = properties.length,\n                widths = properties.map(getKeyWidth), // Width of keys, including quotes\n                align = alignmentOptions.on; // \"value\" or \"colon\"\n            let targetWidth = Math.max(...widths),\n                beforeColon, afterColon, mode;\n\n            // Skip alignment for JSX objects\n            if (properties.some(property => property.parent.type === 'JSXExpressionContainer')) {\n                return;\n            }\n\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a condition to check if any of the properties belong to a JSX expression container. If so, the function returns early, skipping the alignment logic. This should prevent the rule from incorrectly re-aligning JSX objects when the `align: 'value'` option is used."
