    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that the ESLint autofix does not incorrectly transform a variable declaration from `let foo = undefined;` to `const foo;`, which is invalid in JavaScript. The root cause of the issue is that the `prefer-const` rule is being applied without considering the initialization value of `undefined`, which should not be removed when converting `let` to `const`.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image shows an ESLint error where a variable initialized with `undefined` is incorrectly transformed to a `const` declaration without an initializer, leading to a syntax error. The root cause is the incorrect handling of the `no-undef-init` rule in conjunction with the `prefer-const` rule, where the order of rule application and the fix logic do not account for the need to retain the `undefined` initializer when converting to `const`.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `lib/rules/prefer-const.js` file, where the logic for applying the `prefer-const` fix does not account for the presence of an `undefined` initializer. We need to modify the fix logic to ensure that when converting `let` to `const`, the initializer is retained if it is `undefined`.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/prefer-const.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfix: shouldFix\n    ? fixer => fixer.replaceText(\n        sourceCode.getFirstToken(varDeclParent, t => t.value === varDeclParent.kind),\n        \"const\"\n    )\n    : null\n=======\nfix: shouldFix\n    ? fixer => {\n        const firstDeclaration = varDeclParent.declarations[0];\n        const initText = firstDeclaration.init ? sourceCode.getText(firstDeclaration.init) : \"\";\n\n        return fixer.replaceTextRange(\n            [varDeclParent.range[0], firstDeclaration.range[1]],\n            `const ${sourceCode.getText(firstDeclaration.id)}${initText ? ` = ${initText}` : \"\"}`\n        );\n    }\n    : null\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The patch modifies the fix logic in the `prefer-const` rule to ensure that when a `let` declaration is converted to `const`, the initializer is retained if it exists.\n- The `fixer.replaceTextRange` method is used to replace the entire declaration, including the initializer, ensuring that `const foo = undefined;` is the result instead of `const foo;`.\n- This change ensures that the transformation respects the original initialization, preventing syntax errors when the initializer is `undefined`."
