        "explanation": "1. 'lib/rules/prefer-const.js': This file contains the implementation of the 'prefer-const' rule, which suggests using 'const' for variables that are never reassigned. The bug is related to this rule incorrectly transforming variables initialized with 'undefined' to 'const' without an initializer.\n\n2. 'lib/rules/no-undef-init.js': This file implements the 'no-undef-init' rule, which disallows initializing variables to 'undefined'. The interaction between this rule and the 'prefer-const' rule is causing the issue, as the 'prefer-const' rule is applied before 'no-undef-init', leading to the removal of the 'undefined' initializer.\n\n3. 'lib/linter/source-code-fixer.js': This file is responsible for applying fixes to the source code. The bug involves the autofix process, which is managed by this file, incorrectly applying the 'prefer-const' rule fix without considering the 'no-undef-init' rule, resulting in a JavaScript error.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves ESLint's autofix feature incorrectly transforming variables initialized with 'undefined' to 'const' without an initializer, causing JavaScript errors. The user expected the variable to be transformed to 'const' but retain the 'undefined' initializer, as per the 'no-undef-init' rule."
