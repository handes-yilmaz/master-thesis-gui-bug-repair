        "explanation": "1. **lib/rules/constructor-super.js**: This file contains the rule definition for verifying 'super()' calls in constructors. The error message 'Cannot read property 'superCalled' of undefined' suggests that there might be an issue with how 'super()' calls are being tracked or verified in this rule. The file includes logic for checking if 'super()' is called in constructors, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n2. **lib/linter.js**: This file is responsible for the main linting logic, including parsing and verifying JavaScript code. The error message indicates a parsing error, which suggests that there might be an issue with how the linter is processing the code, particularly in relation to 'super()' calls. The linter's handling of AST nodes and rule application could be contributing to the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an ESLint error where the property 'superCalled' is being accessed on an undefined object. This occurs in a JavaScript class that extends another class, and the error is related to the use of the 'super()' call in the constructor. The error message indicates a parsing error with an unexpected token, which suggests that the issue might be related to the handling of 'super()' calls in the ESLint configuration or rules."
