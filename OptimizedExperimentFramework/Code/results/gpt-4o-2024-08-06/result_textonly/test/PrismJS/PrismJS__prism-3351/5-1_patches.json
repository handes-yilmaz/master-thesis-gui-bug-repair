    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the \"UUID\" is correctly highlighted as a \"class-name\" token in the Java language definition for Prism. The problem arises because the current regex pattern for class names does not account for class names that consist entirely of uppercase letters, such as \"UUID\". \n\nLet's analyze the provided code snippet and identify the necessary changes:\n\n1. **Bug Root Cause Analysis:**\n   - The current regex pattern for class names in the `components/prism-java.js` file does not match class names that are entirely uppercase, such as \"UUID\". The pattern expects at least one lowercase letter in the class name, which is not the case for \"UUID\".\n\n2. **Bug Location:**\n   - The issue is located in the `className` pattern definition within the `components/prism-java.js` file. Specifically, the regex pattern for class names needs to be adjusted to allow for class names that are entirely uppercase.\n\n3. **Patch Generation:**\n   - We need to modify the regex pattern for class names to include names that are entirely uppercase. This can be done by adjusting the pattern to allow for uppercase letters without requiring a lowercase letter.\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-java.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nvar className = {\n    pattern: RegExp(classNamePrefix + /[A-Z](?:[\\d_A-Z]*[a-z]\\w*)?\\b/.source),\n    lookbehind: true,\n    inside: {\n        'namespace': {\n            pattern: /^[a-z]\\w*(?:\\s*\\.\\s*[a-z]\\w*)*(?:\\s*\\.)?/,\n            inside: {\n                'punctuation': /\\./\n            }\n        },\n        'punctuation': /\\./\n    }\n};\n=======\nvar className = {\n    pattern: RegExp(classNamePrefix + /[A-Z](?:[\\d_A-Z]*[a-z]\\w*)?\\b|[A-Z]+\\b/.source),\n    lookbehind: true,\n    inside: {\n        'namespace': {\n            pattern: /^[a-z]\\w*(?:\\s*\\.\\s*[a-z]\\w*)*(?:\\s*\\.)?/,\n            inside: {\n                'punctuation': /\\./\n            }\n        },\n        'punctuation': /\\./\n    }\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Patch:**\n- The regex pattern for `className` is modified to include an alternative pattern `|[A-Z]+\\b` which matches class names that consist entirely of uppercase letters. This ensures that \"UUID\" and similar class names are correctly identified as \"class-name\" tokens."
