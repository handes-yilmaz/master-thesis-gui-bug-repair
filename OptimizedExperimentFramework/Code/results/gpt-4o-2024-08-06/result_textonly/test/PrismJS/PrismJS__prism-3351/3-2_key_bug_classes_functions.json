        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting rules defined for Java in the Prism library, specifically in the 'components/prism-java.js' file. This file contains the Java language definition, including patterns for identifying keywords, class names, and other elements of the Java syntax. The 'class-name' pattern is directly responsible for identifying and highlighting Java class names, such as 'UUID'. However, the current implementation fails to correctly recognize 'UUID' as a class name token, leading to the observed bug. Thus, modifications or corrections to the class-name matching logic in this file are necessary to resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the incorrect highlighting of the 'UUID' keyword in Java code by the Prism library, which should be treated as a 'class-name' but is rendered as plain text. This issue is observed in the Prism version 1.27.0 when used in browsers, including on the HackerTalk website editor."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the incorrect rendering of the 'UUID' keyword in Java, which should be highlighted as a class name. In the compressed bug files, particularly in 'components/prism-java.js', the logic for determining Java class names is defined. This file contains the patterns and rules for syntax highlighting specific to the Java language, including the definition of 'class-name' tokens. Since 'UUID' is a class in Java, the issue likely arises from this file's logic not correctly identifying and classifying 'UUID' as a class name. Therefore, inspecting and possibly modifying the pattern matching or logic related to class names in 'components/prism-java.js' is necessary to address this bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting of the 'UUID' keyword in Java code using the Prism syntax highlighter. The issue is that 'UUID' is being rendered as plain text instead of being highlighted as a 'class-name' token, as it should be according to Java syntax rules."
