    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the incorrect SQL comment highlighting. The problem is that the SQL comment is not being highlighted correctly, which suggests an issue with the regular expression used to identify comments in the SQL language definition.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that SQL comments are not being highlighted correctly. The provided SQL code includes a comment line starting with `--`, which is a standard SQL comment syntax. The issue likely lies in the regular expression pattern used to detect comments in the SQL language definition within the Prism.js library.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely the regular expression pattern used to match comments in the SQL language definition. The pattern may not be correctly identifying comments that start with `--` and continue to the end of the line.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-sql.js` and `components/prism-sql.min.js` files. The regular expression pattern for comments is defined as follows:\n\n```javascript\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n}\n```\n\nThe pattern `(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*` is intended to match comments starting with `--`, `//`, or `#`, but it may not be correctly handling the end-of-line aspect for `--` comments.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the regular expression correctly matches comments that start with `--` and continue to the end of the line. We can modify the pattern to explicitly match the end of the line after `--`.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-sql.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n=======\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#)[^\\r\\n]*)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-sql.min.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncomment:{pattern:/(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*)/,lookbehind:!0},\n=======\ncomment:{pattern:/(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#)[^\\r\\n]*)/,lookbehind:!0},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The regular expression pattern for comments has been updated to ensure that comments starting with `--`, `//`, or `#` are matched correctly up to the end of the line.\n- The change involves replacing `.*` with `[^\\r\\n]*` to explicitly match any character except a newline, ensuring that the comment is correctly highlighted up to the end of the line."
