        "explanation": "The issue lies within the syntax definition for SQL comments in the PrismJS library. The relevant class is `Prism.languages.sql` found in the files `components/prism-sql.js` and `components/prism-sql.min.js`. The definition for the 'comment' pattern is responsible for matching SQL comments. The bug seems to originate from incorrect handling or pattern matching for comments, as the highlighting is not correctly applied to SQL comment syntax (e.g., '--'). Therefore, the `comment` pattern within this `Prism.languages.sql` class needs to be examined and potentially modified to resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting for SQL comments in a syntax highlighting library, PrismJS. The specific issue is that SQL comments starting with '--' are not being highlighted correctly in the provided example code, leading to visual errors in the highlighted SQL code."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of SQL comments, which is defined in the 'components/prism-sql.js' file. In this file, the regular expression pattern for detecting SQL comments may not be functioning correctly, leading to the improper highlighting of comment lines. This is the most relevant class to address because it directly contains the logic for parsing and highlighting SQL syntax, including comments. No specific functions are identified as the bug seems to be directly related to the pattern definitions within the class.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting of SQL comments in a code editor or viewer using Prism.js. Specifically, the SQL comment line starting with '--' is not being highlighted correctly, which affects the visual representation of SQL scripts. This issue is visible in the provided image where SQL comments are not distinguished from other parts of the code."
