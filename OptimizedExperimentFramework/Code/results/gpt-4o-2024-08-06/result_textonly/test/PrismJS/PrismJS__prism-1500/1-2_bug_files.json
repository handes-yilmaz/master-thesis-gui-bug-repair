        "explanation": "The files 'components/prism-sql.js' and 'components/prism-sql.min.js' are directly related to the bug because these files contain the SQL syntax definition and rules used by prism.js to perform syntax highlighting for SQL code blocks. To fix the issue with SQL comments causing incorrect highlighting, modifications are likely needed in these files to adjust how comments are recognized and processed within the SQL language parsing logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where SQL comment lines are causing incorrect syntax highlighting in SQL code blocks. Specifically, when a SQL comment (indicated by --) is present, the test page using prism.js for highlighting does not correctly recognize the lines following the comment as SQL code, thereby causing highlighting errors."

            "prism.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to incorrect syntax highlighting for SQL, particularly with comments. Therefore, the most relevant files are the ones that handle the SQL syntax within prism.js, namely `components/prism-sql.js` and its minified version `components/prism-sql.min.js`. These files likely contain the logic for SQL syntax highlighting. Since the main prism.js file orchestrates the overall parsing and highlighting across different languages, it could also be relevant to the bug as potential changes at the core might propagate an incorrect highlighting behavior. Hence, all these files should be examined to find and fix the incorrect syntax highlighting behavior for SQL comments in Prism.",
        "bug_scenario": "The user reported that the SQL code snippet provided in the bug report is being incorrectly highlighted by a syntax highlighter (prism.js), specifically when SQL comments are included. The highlighted code appears differently than expected, leading to confusion or incorrect interpretation of the code's syntax."
