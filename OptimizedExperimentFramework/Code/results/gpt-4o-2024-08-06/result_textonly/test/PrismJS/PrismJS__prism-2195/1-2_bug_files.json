        "explanation": "The file \"components/prism-visual-basic.js\" is directly related to the Visual Basic syntax highlighting, and given the bug is about Visual Basic comment highlighting, this is certainly where the issue may need to be corrected. Additionally, \"components/prism-core.js\" is likely involved as it may contain the core logic for parsing and tokenization applicable across different languages, which includes handling of special characters like line continuations. The core logic might need adjustments to properly recognize the Visual Basic comment conversion when line continuations are present.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the syntax highlighting of comments in Visual Basic, specifically when line continuation underscores are used at the end of the line. The issue is that the comment continues past the underscore instead of being treated as a single comment token. This is evident in the provided image where the comment color is not applied correctly after the underscore."

        ],
        "explanation": "The file 'components/prism-visual-basic.js' is directly related because it likely contains the code responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Visual Basic, including comment and line continuation handling. Fixing the issue with comments not being highlighted due to line continuation requires adjustments in this file to correctly parse and highlight these types of comments.\n\nThe file 'components/prism-core.js' is suspected of being related because it might handle core functionalities for tokenizing code, and line continuation handling could be integrated into the tokenization logic. It may need adjustments to support multi-line comment tokens when a line continuation symbol is encountered.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the Visual Basic syntax highlighting, where comments that are followed by a line continuation symbol are not properly highlighted. The scenario involves treating a comment line that ends with an underscore (which indicates continuation) as a single token, similar to how a regular comment without continuation would be treated."
