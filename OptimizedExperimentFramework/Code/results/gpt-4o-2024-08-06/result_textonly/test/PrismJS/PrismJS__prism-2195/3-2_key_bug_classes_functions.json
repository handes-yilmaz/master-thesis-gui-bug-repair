        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of Visual Basic comments, specifically when using line continuations. In the compressed bug file 'components/prism-visual-basic.js', the syntax definition for comments is provided under 'Prism.languages['visual-basic']'. This includes the pattern matching logic for comments, which currently does not account for line continuations. The function needs to be modified to recognize and properly highlight comments that continue onto the next line using the '_' character.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves comments in Visual Basic not being properly highlighted when a line continuation character ('_') is used at the end of the comment line. The image shows a code snippet where the comment line does not extend to the next line as expected, indicating the highlighting issue."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The key bug-related file is 'components/prism-visual-basic.js', where the language definition for Visual Basic is defined. The main issue lies in the regex patterns used for matching comments and directives. Specifically, the pattern for comments does not account for line continuation, which is causing the comments not to be highlighted correctly when they span multiple lines. Adjusting these patterns to include line continuation characters would likely resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves Visual Basic comments not highlighting correctly when using line continuation. The issue is that the comment underline at the end of a line is not being treated as part of the comment token, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting."
