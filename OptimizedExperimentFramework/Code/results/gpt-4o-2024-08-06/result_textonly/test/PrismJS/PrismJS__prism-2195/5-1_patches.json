    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that comments in Visual Basic are correctly highlighted even when they are continued onto the next line using the line continuation character (`_`). The current implementation does not handle this scenario, which is why comments are not being highlighted correctly when they span multiple lines.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario image shows a Visual Basic code snippet where a comment is not being highlighted correctly. The comment is split across multiple lines using the line continuation character (`_`). The issue arises because the current pattern for comments does not account for line continuation, treating each line separately instead of as a single comment block.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is the regular expression pattern used to match comments in the `Prism.languages['visual-basic']` configuration. The pattern does not consider the possibility of a comment being continued onto the next line using the line continuation character (`_`). As a result, only the first line of the comment is recognized, and the continuation lines are not treated as part of the comment.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch\nThe bug is located in the `comment` pattern of the `Prism.languages['visual-basic']` configuration. We need to modify the pattern to include the line continuation character and treat the entire block as a single comment.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-visual-basic.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(?:['\u2018\u2019]|REM\\b).*/i,\n    inside: {\n        'keyword': /^REM/i\n    }\n},\n=======\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(?:['\u2018\u2019]|REM\\b)(?:[^\\S\\r\\n]*_[^\\S\\r\\n]*(?:\\r\\n?|\\n)|.)*/i,\n    inside: {\n        'keyword': /^REM/i\n    }\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original pattern for comments only matches a single line starting with a comment character or the `REM` keyword.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The updated pattern includes the line continuation character (`_`) followed by optional whitespace and a newline. This allows the pattern to match comments that span multiple lines, treating them as a single token. The `(?:[^\\S\\r\\n]*_[^\\S\\r\\n]*(?:\\r\\n?|\\n)|.)*` part of the pattern ensures that any line continuation is included in the comment block."
