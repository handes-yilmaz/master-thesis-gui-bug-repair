    "1/1": "To address the bug report, we need to add support for the Apex language by essentially aliasing it to the Java language definition. The bug report suggests that Apex is very similar to Java, and thus, we can use the existing Java language definition for Apex. The provided code snippet in the bug report shows how this can be done in a straightforward manner.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe bug report and the image suggest that the current system does not recognize Apex as a separate language, even though it is syntactically similar to Java. The image likely shows an error or a lack of syntax highlighting for Apex code, indicating that the language is not supported.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause of the issue is the absence of a language definition for Apex in the system. Since Apex is similar to Java, we can alias the Java language definition to Apex, allowing the system to recognize and correctly highlight Apex code.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nWe need to make changes in the `components/index.js` file to ensure that Apex is recognized as a language and is correctly aliased to Java. We will add a new file `components/prism-apex.js` to define the alias.\n\n### Patches\n\n1. **Create a new file `components/prism-apex.js`** to alias Apex to Java:\n\n```javascript\n// components/prism-apex.js\n;(function (Prism) {\n  Prism.languages.apex = Prism.languages.java;\n})(Prism);\n```\n\n2. **Modify `components/index.js`** to include the new Apex language:\n\n```javascript\n### components/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst pathToLanguage = './prism-' + lang;\n=======\nconst pathToLanguage = lang === 'apex' ? './prism-apex' : './prism-' + lang;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes will ensure that Apex is recognized as a language and will use the Java language definition for syntax highlighting. The new file `components/prism-apex.js` will alias Apex to Java, and the modification in `components/index.js` will ensure that the new alias is loaded correctly."
