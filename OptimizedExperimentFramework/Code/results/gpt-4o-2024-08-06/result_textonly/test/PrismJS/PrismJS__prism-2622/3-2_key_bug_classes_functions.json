        "explanation": "The bug scenario revolves around adding support for the Apex language by aliasing it to Java within the Prism syntax highlighter. The key files involved in this scenario are:\n\n1. **components/prism-java.js**: This file contains the Java language definition. Since the suggestion is to alias Apex to Java, any modifications or additions to support Apex would likely involve changes or additions here to ensure compatibility and proper aliasing.\n\n2. **components/index.js//loadLanguages**: This function is responsible for loading language definitions into the Prism instance. To properly alias Apex to Java, changes may be required in this function to ensure the correct behavior when loading the Apex language, primarily ensuring it maps to the Java definitions correctly and efficiently. This function is central to managing how languages are loaded, making it crucial for implementing the alias behavior described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report discusses the need to add support for the Apex programming language in a syntax highlighting library. The report suggests that Apex is similar to Java and questions whether a separate full language definition is necessary, proposing instead to alias Apex to Java. The provided code snippet demonstrates this by assigning the Java language definition to Apex within the Prism library."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to adding support for a new language (Apex) by treating it as an alias of an existing language (Java). The file `components/prism-java.js` is important because it contains the definition of the Java language in the Prism library. Modifications to this file might be necessary to either extend its functionality to alias Apex or to ensure compatibility with such an alias. The function `loadLanguages` in `components/index.js` is responsible for loading language definitions into the Prism instance. This function would need to recognize and correctly handle the new alias for Apex, ensuring that when 'apex' is requested, it loads the Java language definition instead. These components are crucial for implementing the feature requested in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves adding support for the Apex programming language in a syntax highlighting library. The report suggests that Apex is very similar to Java, and questions whether it's necessary to define a completely new language specification for Apex when it could be treated as an alias for Java. The image provided shows a code snippet that attempts to alias the Apex language to Java using the Prism library."
