        "explanation": "The bug report requests adding a new language definition for 'gcode' in the Prism library. The compressed bug files indicate that core functionalities like language definition extensions and language insertion are handled in 'components/prism-core.js'. This file contains comments and functions related to extending and inserting language definitions, which are key to implementing the requested G-code highlighting feature. The existing code snippet from the bug report also hints that the implementation involves defining a language with specific syntax patterns (keywords, comments, properties), which aligns with the capabilities provided in 'prism-core.js' for handling language definitions.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves adding G-code syntax highlighting support to the Prism library, using the language identifier 'gcode'. G-code is a widely used numerical control programming language. The request is to include this syntax highlighting by implementing it in the existing Prism library, potentially using an existing implementation from a GitHub repository."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the need to extend the Prism library to include support for G-code syntax highlighting. In the compressed bug files provided, the file `components/prism-core.js` contains the core functionalities of the Prism library, including methods for defining and extending language syntax highlighting features. To add a new syntax highlighting language, modifications or extensions need to be made within this core file, particularly in the sections where languages are defined and extended. The request in the bug report directly relates to extending the language capabilities of Prism, which is why `prism-core.js` is identified as the key file to edit for implementing this feature.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the request to add syntax highlighting for G-code in Prism, a lightweight and robust syntax highlighting library. The request is to add a new language identifier `gcode` for G-code syntax highlighting, which is a widely used numerical control programming language. There is an existing implementation available in an external GitHub repository which provides the basic structure for G-code syntax highlighting."
