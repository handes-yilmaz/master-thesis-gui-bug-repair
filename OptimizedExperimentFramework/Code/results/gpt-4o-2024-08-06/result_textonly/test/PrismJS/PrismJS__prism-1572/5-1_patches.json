    "1/1": "To address the request for adding \"G-code\" syntax highlighting to Prism with the language identifier `gcode`, we need to integrate the G-code language definition into the Prism library. The provided bug report includes a sample implementation of the G-code syntax highlighting, which we can use as a reference.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report requests the addition of G-code syntax highlighting to the Prism library. The provided implementation from the GitHub repository defines the G-code language with specific patterns for comments, keywords, and properties. The bug scenario image shows an example of G-code syntax highlighting, indicating the expected outcome once the feature is implemented.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is the absence of a G-code language definition in the Prism library. Without this definition, Prism cannot recognize and highlight G-code syntax.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to add the G-code language definition to the `components/prism-core.js` file. We will define the G-code language using the patterns provided in the bug report.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-core.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\tlanguages: {\n=======\n\\tlanguages: {\n\\t\\tgcode: {\n\\t\\t\\tcomment: /;.*/,\n\\t\\t\\tkeyword: /\\b(G[\\d]+|M[\\d]+)\\b/g,\n\\t\\t\\tproperty: /\\b(X|Y|Z|E|F|S|P|T|I|J|D|H|R|Q|N|\\*)/g\n\\t\\t},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We added a new language definition for `gcode` under the `languages` object in the `prism-core.js` file.\n- The `gcode` language includes patterns for comments, keywords, and properties, as specified in the bug report.\n- This change will enable Prism to recognize and highlight G-code syntax when the `gcode` language identifier is used."
