        "explanation": "To implement G-code highlighting, a new syntax file needs to be added to the Prism library's components directory. Based on the repository structure, Prism organizes language definitions in individual files within the 'components' directory. A new file named `prism-gcode.js` should be created with the G-code syntax definition provided in the bug report. Additionally, a minified version, `prism-gcode.min.js`, should be added for production use. These files will contain the syntax definition necessary for the Prism library to recognize and highlight G-code properly, as described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The user has requested to add G-code syntax highlighting to the Prism library using `gcode` as the language identifier. G-code is a numerical control language for CNC machines and has specific syntax elements that need to be highlighted for code clarity and readability. The bug report includes a request to integrate this functionality, referring to an existing solution for syntax highlighting, and providing a code snippet that defines the patterns for comments, keywords, and properties in G-code."

            "components/prism-gml.min.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "To implement G-code syntax highlighting, one would need to create a new `prism-gcode.js` file within the `components/` directory, similar to how other languages are integrated into Prism. This is suggested by the existing repository structure where each language has its own `prism-{language}.js` file. The `prism-core.js` file and its minified version could be relevant because they may handle the overall setup of languages within Prism.js, although you would mainly focus on creating a new component file for the G-code syntax itself. The `prism-gml.js` file might be a potential starting point based on its nomenclature, but ultimately the creation of something like `prism-gcode.js` is required for implementing new syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report highlights a request to add syntax highlighting for G-code using the `gcode` language identifier in the Prism.js library. G-code is a language widely used in computer numerical control (CNC) machine programming. The provided snippet shows a simple definition of G-code syntax highlighting and an image titled 'gcode-syntax-highlight' likely demonstrates the desired outcome when this implementation is applied."
