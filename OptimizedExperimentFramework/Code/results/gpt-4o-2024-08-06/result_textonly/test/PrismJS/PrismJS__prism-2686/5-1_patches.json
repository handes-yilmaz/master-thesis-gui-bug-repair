    "1/1": "To address the bug related to the \"Shell session\" tokenizer in Prism, let's analyze the provided information and code snippets.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n**Bug Scenario Images Description:**\n1. The first image shows the correct syntax highlighting for a shell session, where commands and outputs are distinctly highlighted.\n2. The second image shows the incorrect syntax highlighting, where the entire shell session appears as plain text without any differentiation between commands and outputs.\n3. The third image shows the DOM structure, indicating that the tokenizer is not correctly identifying and applying styles to the shell session components.\n\n**Root Cause Reasoning:**\nThe issue seems to be with the tokenizer for the \"shell-session\" language in Prism. The tokenizer is not correctly parsing and applying styles to the shell session components, such as commands and outputs. This could be due to changes in the regular expressions or the logic that processes the shell session strings.\n\n### Bug Localization\n\nThe bug is likely located in the regular expressions or the logic that defines the \"shell-session\" language in the provided code snippets. Specifically, the issue might be with how the `command` and `output` patterns are defined and processed.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\nLet's generate patches to fix the issue in the provided code snippets.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-shell-session.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\'output\\': /.(?:.*(?:[\\\\r\\\\n]|.$))*/\n=======\n\\t\\t\\'output\\': {\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(?:^|\\\\n)(?![$#])(?:[^\\\\r\\\\n]|\\\\r?(?:\\\\n|$))+/,\n\\t\\t\\talias: \\'output\\'\n\\t\\t}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-shell-session.min.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n},output:/.(?:.*(?:[\\\\r\\\\n]|.$))*/},s.languages[\"sh-session\"]=s.languages.shellsession=s.languages[\"shell-session\"]}(Prism);\n=======\n},\"output\":{pattern:/(?:^|\\\\n)(?![$#])(?:[^\\\\r\\\\n]|\\\\r?(?:\\\\n|$))+/,alias:\"output\"}},s.languages[\"sh-session\"]=s.languages.shellsession=s.languages[\"shell-session\"]}(Prism);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- **Output Pattern Fix:** The `output` pattern was previously too broad and did not correctly differentiate between command outputs and other text. The new pattern ensures that outputs are correctly identified by looking for lines that do not start with shell symbols (`$` or `#`), which are typically used to denote commands.\n- **Alias Addition:** The `output` pattern is given an alias of `'output'` to ensure that it is styled correctly in the DOM.\n\nThese changes should help the tokenizer correctly parse and highlight shell session components, restoring the expected behavior."
