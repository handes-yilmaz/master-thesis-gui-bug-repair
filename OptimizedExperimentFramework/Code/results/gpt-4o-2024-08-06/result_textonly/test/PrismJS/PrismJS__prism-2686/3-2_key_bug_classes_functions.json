        "explanation": "The bug is related to the 'Shell session' language tokenizer, which is defined in the 'components/prism-shell-session.js' file. This file contains the implementation of the tokenizer for the 'shell-session' language in Prism.js, including patterns for command and output tokenization. The issue likely resides in this file because it directly handles the tokenization process for the 'Shell session' language. If the tokenizer is not working correctly, the problem is most likely rooted in the patterns or logic defined within this file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Shell session' language tokenizer in Prism.js, which is broken in versions 1.22 and 1.23 downloaded from the web. The tokenizer used to work correctly in earlier downloads of version 1.22, but recent downloads show incorrect tokenization, as evidenced by the screenshots. The screenshots show a lack of syntax highlighting in the 'Shell session' language, and an inspection of the DOM tree indicates that the tokenizer is not functioning properly."

        "explanation": "The compressed bug files point to 'components/prism-shell-session.js' and 'components/prism-shell-session.min.js' as the files defining the tokenization logic for the 'shell-session' language. The problem likely lies within these files, as they contain the regular expressions and patterns used to identify and highlight shell commands and outputs. Since the bug report describes an issue with tokenization, these files are directly related to the issue because they define the 'command', 'output', and the internal structures that are not working as expected.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect tokenization of the 'Shell session' language in the Prism library when downloaded from the web. Previously, versions 1.22 and 1.23 worked correctly, but recent downloads have broken highlighting for shell sessions. The example provided demonstrates this issue, where commands and outputs in shell sessions are not being highlighted properly, as observed in the DOM tree of the test drive page."
