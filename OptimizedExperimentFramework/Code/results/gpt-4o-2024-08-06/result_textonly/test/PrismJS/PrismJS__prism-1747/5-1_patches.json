    "1/1": "To address the bug related to the incorrect handling of empty strings in Smalltalk syntax highlighting, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and generate patches to fix the issue.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Description**: The bug report indicates that empty strings in Smalltalk are not being handled correctly. Specifically, the example `anObject withEmptyString: ''  shouldNotBeGreenHere: 'shouldBeGreenHere'` shows that the empty string `''` is not being processed as expected, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n2. **Bug Scenario Images**: \n   - The first image from `https://prismjs.com/test.html` shows incorrect syntax highlighting where the empty string is not recognized properly.\n   - The second image from `http://rouge.jneen.net/` shows the correct syntax highlighting where the empty string is handled correctly.\n\n3. **Root Cause**: The root cause of the issue is likely due to the regular expression pattern used to match strings in the Smalltalk language definition. The current pattern does not account for empty strings, which leads to incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is from `components/prism-smalltalk.js`:\n\n```javascript\nPrism.languages.smalltalk = {\n    'comment': /\"(?:\"\"|[^\"])+\"/,\n    'string': /'(?:''|[^'])+'/,\n    ...\n};\n```\n\n- The `string` pattern is defined as `/'(?:''|[^'])+'/`, which matches strings enclosed in single quotes. However, it does not correctly handle empty strings because it expects at least one character between the quotes.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `string` pattern to correctly match empty strings. The updated pattern should allow for zero or more characters between the quotes.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-smalltalk.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    'string': /'(?:''|[^'])+'/,\n=======\n    'string': /'(?:''|[^'])*'/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Pattern**: `/'(?:''|[^'])+'/` - This pattern requires at least one character between the single quotes, which fails to match empty strings.\n- **Updated Pattern**: `/'(?:''|[^'])*'/` - This pattern allows for zero or more characters between the single quotes, thus correctly matching empty strings as well.\n\nBy applying this patch, the Smalltalk syntax highlighting should correctly handle empty strings, resolving the issue described in the bug report."
