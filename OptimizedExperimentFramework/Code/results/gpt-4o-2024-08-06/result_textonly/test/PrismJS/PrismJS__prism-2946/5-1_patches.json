    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the incorrect rendering of reST links and verbatim elements. The problem is that these elements are not being detected correctly, resulting in the entire text being italicized instead of being highlighted as links or verbatim text.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that when reST links and verbatim elements are placed on a single line, they are not detected correctly and are rendered as italic text. However, when split into two lines, they render correctly. This suggests that the current regex patterns used for detecting these elements might not be handling single-line cases properly.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe issue likely resides in the regex patterns used in the `components/prism-rest.js` file, specifically within the `inline` and `link` sections. These sections are responsible for detecting inline elements such as links and verbatim text.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the regex patterns to correctly identify reST links and verbatim elements even when they are on a single line. We will modify the patterns in the `inline` and `link` sections to ensure they correctly capture these elements.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-rest.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[\\\\s\\\\-:\\\\/\\'\"<(\\\\[{])(?::[^:]+:`.*?`|`.*?`:[^:]+:|(\\\\*\\\\*?|``?|\\\\|)(?!\\\\s).*?\\\\S\\\\2(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$))/m,\n=======\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[\\\\s\\\\-:\\\\/\\'\"<(\\\\[{])(?::[^:]+:`.*?`|`.*?`:[^:]+:|(\\\\*\\\\*?|``?|\\\\|)(?!\\\\s).*?\\\\S\\\\2(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$)|`[^`]+`_)/m,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n### components/prism-rest.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(?:\\\\b[a-z\\\\d]+(?:[_.:+][a-z\\\\d]+)*_?_|`[^`]+`_?_|_`[^`]+`)(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$)/i,\n=======\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(?:\\\\b[a-z\\\\d]+(?:[_.:+][a-z\\\\d]+)*_?_|`[^`]+`_?_|_`[^`]+`|`[^`]+`_)(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$)/i,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Inline Pattern Adjustment**: The `inline` pattern is modified to include a case for detecting backtick-enclosed text followed by an underscore (e.g., `` `text`_ ``), which is a common pattern for reST links.\n\n2. **Link Pattern Adjustment**: The `link` pattern is similarly adjusted to ensure that it captures backtick-enclosed text followed by an underscore, which was previously not being detected correctly.\n\nThese changes should ensure that reST links and verbatim elements are correctly highlighted, even when they appear on a single line."
