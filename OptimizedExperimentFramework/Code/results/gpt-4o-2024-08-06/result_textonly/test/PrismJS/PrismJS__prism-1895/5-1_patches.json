    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to update the JavaScript language definition in the Prism library to correctly handle numeric separators. The bug report indicates that numeric literals with underscores (e.g., `1_000_000`) are not being highlighted correctly. This is likely because the current regular expression for numbers does not account for underscores within numeric literals.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe bug scenario images show numeric literals with underscores being highlighted incorrectly. The root cause is that the regular expression used to match numbers in the Prism JavaScript language definition does not include support for numeric separators, which are valid in JavaScript as per the TC39 proposal.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch\nThe bug is located in the `number` pattern of the JavaScript language definition in the `components/prism-javascript.js` file. We need to modify the regular expression to allow underscores within numeric literals.\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-javascript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t'number': /\\b(?:(?:0[xX][\\dA-Fa-f]+|0[bB][01]+|0[oO][0-7]+)n?|\\d+n|NaN|Infinity)\\b|(?:\\b\\d+\\.?\\d*|\\B\\.\\d+)(?:[Ee][+-]?\\d+)?/,\n=======\n\\t'number': /\\b(?:(?:0[xX][\\dA-Fa-f]+|0[bB][01]+|0[oO][0-7]+)n?|(?:\\d+(_\\d+)*)(?:\\.\\d+(_\\d+)*)?|NaN|Infinity)\\b|(?:\\b\\d+\\.?\\d*|\\B\\.\\d+)(?:[Ee][+-]?\\d+)?/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The updated regular expression for `number` now includes `(?:\\d+(_\\d+)*)` to match integers with underscores and `(?:\\.\\d+(_\\d+)*)?` to match decimal numbers with underscores.\n- This change allows numeric literals with underscores to be correctly recognized and highlighted by the Prism library."
