        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Markdown syntax parsing, specifically how the parser handles italics and bold styles. In the repository structure, the file `components/prism-markdown.js` is responsible for handling Markdown language syntax and styles in the Prism library. Therefore, this file is directly related to the bug and needs to be modified to adjust the regular expressions or logic handling the matching of italic and bold text markers. A solution would involve modifying the pattern to appropriately handle different Markdown formatting rules without overly greedy matches.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the greedy matching behavior of italic and bold formatting in Markdown when using * and _. The provided code snippet *italicizes* and **bolds** text by overly matching the leading and trailing punctuation marks, causing incorrect formatting when overlapping or nested styles are used, as illustrated with the example \\\"*__foo__* or _**bar**_\\\"."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to Markdown text processing specifically regarding the handling of italic and bold syntax using asterisks and underscores. Therefore, files involving the implementation of Markdown language parsing, such as `prism-markdown.js` and its minified version, are directly relevant. These files likely contain the logic for parsing and rendering Markdown texts and need modification to handle the greedy matching issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with Markdown text formatting where the use of asterisks (*) and underscores (_) for italic and bold text is excessively greedy. This means that the system matches too many leading or trailing symbols, causing incorrect formatting output. The code example provided showcases the unintended Markdown interpretation of input like `*__foo__*` or `_**bar**_`. These patterns should ideally only match pairs of symbols but seem to over-match, leading to incorrect styling of the text."
