        "explanation": "The bug report describes an issue with C++ code highlighting. In the repository, there are dedicated files for different programming language syntaxes, including 'prism-cpp.js' and 'prism-cpp.min.js', which are responsible for defining the syntax rules for C++. Additionally, PrismJS uses 'prism-clike.js' as a common base for C-style languages, which includes C++. Therefore, modifications are likely needed in these files to fix the highlighting rules for C++ class names. This involves adding or adjusting the pattern that identifies class names within C++ syntax.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the PrismJS syntax highlighter not correctly highlighting certain C++ class names, specifically two scenarios: 'QMainWindow' in the definition `class MainWindow : public QMainWindow` and 'MainWindow' in the method signature `void MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()`. The images and description in the bug report suggest that the PrismJS configuration for C++ is missing rules to properly identify these class names for highlighting."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to syntax highlighting of C++ code, which is typically handled by language definition files in the PrismJS project. In the provided repository structure, the file likely responsible for handling C++ syntax is 'components/prism-cpp.js', as it is specifically named for C++. Additionally, 'components/prism-clike.js' might also be involved because C++, being a C-like language, might share some common syntax definitions with other C-based languages that could be addressed in a shared file. Checking these files for issues related to class name recognition or highlighting logic would be essential to resolve the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario depicted in the report shows that when using PrismJS to highlight C++ syntax, certain elements like class names are not being properly highlighted. Specifically, the class name 'QMainWindow' in the definition 'class MainWindow : public QMainWindow' and 'MainWindow' in the member function 'void MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()' are not highlighted as expected."
