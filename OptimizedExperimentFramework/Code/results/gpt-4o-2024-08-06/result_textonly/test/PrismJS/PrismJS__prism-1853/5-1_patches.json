    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, let's break down the problem and identify the root cause:\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\nThe issue is related to JSON tokenization in the Prism library. The problem arises when the JSON contains a string with the content `\"/*\"`, which is incorrectly interpreted as the start of a comment due to the current regex pattern for comments. This causes the JSON to be highlighted incorrectly, as seen in the provided image.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-json.js` file. The regex pattern for comments is too permissive and incorrectly matches strings that contain comment-like patterns within JSON strings.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to adjust the regex pattern for comments to ensure it does not match strings that are part of JSON values. We can achieve this by ensuring that the comment pattern does not start within a string.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-json.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.json = {\n\t'comment': /\\/\\/.*|\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?(?:\\*\\/|$)/,\n\t'property': {\n\t\tpattern: /\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?=\\s*:)/,\n\t\tgreedy: true\n\t},\n\t'string': {\n\t\tpattern: /\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?!\\s*:)/,\n\t\tgreedy: true\n\t},\n\t'number': /-?\\d+\\.?\\d*(e[+-]?\\d+)?/i,\n\t'punctuation': /[{}[\\],]/,\n\t'operator': /:/,\n\t'boolean': /\\b(?:true|false)\\b/,\n\t'null': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\bnull\\b/,\n\t\talias: 'keyword'\n\t}\n};\n=======\nPrism.languages.json = {\n\t'comment': {\n\t\tpattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\/.*|\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?(?:\\*\\/|$))/,\n\t\tlookbehind: true\n\t},\n\t'property': {\n\t\tpattern: /\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?=\\s*:)/,\n\t\tgreedy: true\n\t},\n\t'string': {\n\t\tpattern: /\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?!\\s*:)/,\n\t\tgreedy: true\n\t},\n\t'number': /-?\\d+\\.?\\d*(e[+-]?\\d+)?/i,\n\t'punctuation': /[{}[\\],]/,\n\t'operator': /:/,\n\t'boolean': /\\b(?:true|false)\\b/,\n\t'null': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\bnull\\b/,\n\t\talias: 'keyword'\n\t}\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Comment Pattern Update**: The comment pattern is updated to use a lookbehind assertion `(^|[^\\\\])` to ensure that the comment does not start within a string. This prevents the regex from matching comment-like patterns within JSON strings.\n- **Lookbehind**: The `lookbehind: true` option is added to ensure the regex engine correctly interprets the lookbehind assertion.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by preventing incorrect tokenization of JSON strings that contain comment-like patterns."
