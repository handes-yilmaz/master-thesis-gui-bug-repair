        "explanation": "The files `components/prism-json.js` and `components/prism-json.min.js` are responsible for defining the JSON language syntax highlighting rules in Prism. The bug report indicates an issue with JSON tokenization, specifically with handling comments like `/*`. The compressed content of these files shows that they contain the patterns for comments, properties, strings, numbers, punctuation, operators, booleans, and null values in JSON. Since the problem is related to how comments are being tokenized, these files are likely the source of the bug and need to be edited to fix the incorrect handling of the `/*` comment syntax.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect JSON tokenization when logging server responses. The issue is triggered by the HTTP header `Accept: */*`, which causes the JSON to be highlighted incorrectly. The provided image shows a JSON object where the comment syntax `/*` is not being handled properly, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting."
