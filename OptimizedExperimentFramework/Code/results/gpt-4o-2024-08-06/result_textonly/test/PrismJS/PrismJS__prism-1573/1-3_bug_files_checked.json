        "explanation": "The file 'components/prism-fsharp.js' is responsible for the syntax highlighting rules specific to the F# language, including how type annotations should be treated. If annotations are not being highlighted, this file likely lacks the necessary rules or patterns to identify and style type annotations in F#. \n\nThe file 'components/prism-core.js' often contains core functions and utilities used across all language definitions in the Prism library. It may need adjustments to support additional styles or modifications needed for F# highlighting that cannot be handled within the language-specific file alone.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report states that F# type annotations are not being highlighted in the given language highlighter tool. The provided image shows an F# code snippet without colored type annotations, indicating that the syntax highlighting is not correctly applying the expected styles, compared to the desired result image which shows proper coloring of F# annotations in Visual Studio."

        ],
        "explanation": "These files are related to the syntax highlighting functionality for the F# programming language. Since the bug report states that F# type annotations are not being highlighted, it is likely that the logic responsible for recognizing and styling these annotations is contained within the F# specific Prism language definition files, namely 'prism-fsharp.js', as well as its minified counterpart 'prism-fsharp.min.js'. These files likely define the syntax rules and token patterns used by the syntax highlighter to differentiate parts of F# source code, including type annotations. Fixing the highlight issue would involve updating these files to correctly identify and style F# type annotations.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with F# type annotations not being highlighted in the code editor. The provided images show a side-by-side comparison of the current scenario (where the annotations are not highlighted) and the desired scenario (using Visual Studio, where the annotations are highlighted appropriately). This indicates a lack of syntax highlighting for F# type annotations which should ideally appear distinct from other code elements, enhancing readability and understanding of the code structure."
