        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of F# code, specifically the type annotations not being highlighted. The files 'components/prism-fsharp.js' and 'components/prism-fsharp.min.js' contain the definition and extension of the F# language syntax highlighting rules in the Prism syntax highlighter library. These files are responsible for defining how different syntactical elements of F# should be highlighted, including comments, keywords, strings, numbers, and preprocessor directives. To fix the issue of type annotations not being highlighted, modifications would likely need to be made in these files to include rules for recognizing and highlighting F# type annotations.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the F# type annotations not being highlighted in a code editor. The provided images show a code snippet where type annotations in F# are not visually distinguished, while the desired result is to have syntax highlighting, as shown in a Visual Studio screenshot where type annotations are highlighted appropriately."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to syntax highlighting for F# type annotations, which is typically handled by language-specific configurations in syntax highlighters like Prism. The file 'components/prism-fsharp.js' contains the definition for F# language syntax in Prism, including keywords, comments, strings, and numbers. The function 'Prism.languages.fsharp' is responsible for extending the base 'clike' language with F# specific patterns. The lack of highlighting for type annotations suggests that this function does not currently handle type annotation patterns, which would need to be added or corrected to fix the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves F# type annotations not being highlighted in the code editor, as depicted in the provided images. The first image shows the current state where type annotations lack color differentiation, while the desired result image shows a Visual Studio screenshot where type annotations are highlighted appropriately."
