    "1/1": "To address the issue of F# type annotations not being highlighted, we need to analyze the provided bug code snippets and make necessary modifications to ensure that type annotations are correctly recognized and highlighted by the syntax highlighter.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that F# type annotations are not being highlighted as expected. The provided images show a comparison between the current state (where type annotations are not highlighted) and the desired state (where type annotations are highlighted in Visual Studio). This suggests that the syntax highlighter configuration for F# in the `prism-fsharp.js` file is missing a rule to recognize and highlight type annotations.\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely the absence of a specific pattern in the `prism-fsharp.js` file to match and highlight F# type annotations. Type annotations in F# typically follow the pattern `: type`, where `type` can be any valid F# type. The current configuration does not seem to include a rule for this pattern.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to add a new pattern to the F# language definition in `prism-fsharp.js` to recognize and highlight type annotations. We will insert this pattern before the existing `keyword` pattern to ensure it is processed correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-fsharp.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('fsharp', 'keyword', {\n    'preprocessor': {\n        pattern: /^[^\\r\\n\\S]*#.*/m,\n        alias: 'property',\n        inside: {\n            'directive': {\n                pattern: /(\\s*#)\\b(?:else|endif|if|light|line|nowarn)\\b/,\n                lookbehind: true,\n                alias: 'keyword'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n=======\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('fsharp', 'keyword', {\n    'type-annotation': {\n        pattern: /(:\\s*\\b\\w+\\b)/,\n        alias: 'class-name'\n    },\n    'preprocessor': {\n        pattern: /^[^\\r\\n\\S]*#.*/m,\n        alias: 'property',\n        inside: {\n            'directive': {\n                pattern: /(\\s*#)\\b(?:else|endif|if|light|line|nowarn)\\b/,\n                lookbehind: true,\n                alias: 'keyword'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We added a new pattern for `type-annotation` that matches the pattern `: type`, where `type` is any word character sequence (`\\b\\w+\\b`).\n- The `alias: 'class-name'` is used to style the type annotations similarly to class names, which is a common practice in syntax highlighting.\n- This pattern is inserted before the `keyword` pattern to ensure it is recognized and highlighted correctly.\n\nThis patch should enable the syntax highlighter to correctly identify and highlight F# type annotations, resolving the issue described in the bug report."
