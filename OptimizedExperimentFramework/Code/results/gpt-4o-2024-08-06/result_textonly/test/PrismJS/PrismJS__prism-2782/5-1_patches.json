    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, let's break down the steps:\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Description**: The issue arises when a string in VB.NET contains an '@' symbol within quotes. The syntax highlighting does not recognize the opening quotes correctly, leading to incorrect highlighting.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The problem is likely due to the regular expression pattern used for matching strings in the syntax highlighter. The '@' symbol is not included in the character set that defines valid characters within a string, causing the parser to misinterpret the string boundaries.\n\n3. **Bug Scenario Image**: The image shows a VB.NET code snippet where the string containing '@' is not highlighted correctly, while a similar string without '@' is highlighted properly. This visual evidence supports the hypothesis that the '@' symbol is not being handled correctly by the syntax highlighter.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is from `components/prism-basic.js`, specifically the regular expression pattern for matching strings:\n\n```javascript\n'string': {\n    pattern: /\"(?:\"\"|[!#$%&'()*,\\/:;<=>?^_ +\\-.A-Z\\d])*\"/i,\n    greedy: true\n},\n```\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to include the '@' symbol in the character set of the regular expression pattern for strings. This will allow the syntax highlighter to correctly recognize strings that contain the '@' symbol.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nHere is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit to fix the bug:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-basic.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': {\n    pattern: /\"(?:\"\"|[!#$%&'()*,\\/:;<=>?^_ +\\-.A-Z\\d])*\"/i,\n    greedy: true\n},\n=======\n'string': {\n    pattern: /\"(?:\"\"|[@!#$%&'()*,\\/:;<=>?^_ +\\-.A-Z\\d])*\"/i,\n    greedy: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **SEARCH Block**: The original pattern does not include the '@' symbol in the character set for strings.\n- **REPLACE Block**: The '@' symbol is added to the character set, allowing the syntax highlighter to correctly parse strings containing '@'.\n\nThis change should resolve the issue without causing regressions, as it only extends the character set for strings in VB.NET, which is unlikely to interfere with other languages."
