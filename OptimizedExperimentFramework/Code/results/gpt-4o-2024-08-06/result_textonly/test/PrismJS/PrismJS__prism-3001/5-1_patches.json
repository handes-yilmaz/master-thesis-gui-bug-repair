    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that TypeScript keywords such as `infer` and `type` are not incorrectly highlighted as keywords when they are followed by alphabetic characters. The issue arises because the current regular expression pattern used to identify these keywords does not account for this scenario.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe bug scenario images show that the keywords `infer` and `type` are being highlighted incorrectly when they are part of longer identifiers like `inference` and `typeDefs`. This is because the regular expression pattern used to match these keywords does not properly exclude cases where they are followed by alphabetic characters.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-typescript.js` file. Specifically, the issue lies in the regular expression pattern used to match TypeScript keywords that need to be followed by an identifier. The current pattern does not correctly handle cases where the keyword is part of a longer identifier.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the regular expression pattern to ensure that these keywords are only highlighted when they are standalone or followed by a non-alphabetic character.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-typescript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n// keywords that have to be followed by an identifier\n// eslint-disable-next-line regexp/no-dupe-characters-character-class\n/\\\\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\\\\s*[^\\\\s_${}*a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])/\n=======\n/\\\\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\\\\s*[^\\\\s_${}*a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])(?=\\\\b|[^a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])/\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The original pattern `/\\\\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\\\\s*[^\\\\s_${}*a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])/` is modified to include a lookahead `(?=\\\\b|[^a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])` which ensures that the keyword is only matched if it is followed by a word boundary or a non-alphabetic character.\n- This change prevents the keywords from being incorrectly highlighted when they are part of longer identifiers, thus resolving the issue described in the bug report."
