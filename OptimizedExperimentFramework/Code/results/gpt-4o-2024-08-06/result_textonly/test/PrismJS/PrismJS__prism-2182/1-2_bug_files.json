        "explanation": "The file `components/prism-elixir.js` is directly responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Elixir code in PrismJS. Since the bug report mentions a specific line in this file that needs to be altered to include an optional '?' in the regex pattern for attribute names, this file is the one that needs to be edited to fix the highlighted issue. The fix involves changing the regex pattern to `'attr-name': /\\w+\\?:/` to correctly identify attributes that end with a '?'. Thus, prism-elixir.js is the file directly related to and requiring modification due to the bug described.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the PrismJS syntax highlighting for Elixir where attribute names ending with a question mark '?' are not correctly identified as tokens. This is because the regex pattern used to match attribute names does not account for an '?' at the end, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting for Elixir code in PrismJS."

        "explanation": "The file 'components/prism-elixir.js' is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the Elixir language in the PrismJS library. The bug reported is specifically about Elixir attributes and their incorrect handling in terms of syntax parsing, which directly implicates this file. The suggested code change, which involves modifying a line of code to update the regex pattern, is also located in this file at line 40. Thus, this file needs to be edited to incorporate the fix for the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting for Elixir attributes that end with a question mark '?'. The current regex used in the PrismJS library to identify such attributes does not account for the question mark, leading to a failure in highlighting them properly."
