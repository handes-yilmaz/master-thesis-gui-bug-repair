    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to update the regex pattern used to identify attribute names in Elixir that can end with a question mark (`?`). The current pattern does not account for this possibility, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is the regex pattern used in the syntax highlighting logic for Elixir code. The pattern does not include an optional question mark at the end of attribute names, which is a valid syntax in Elixir. This omission results in attributes ending with `?` not being recognized correctly.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the file `components/prism-elixir.js` at line 40, as indicated in the bug report. The regex pattern for `'attr-name'` needs to be updated to include an optional question mark.\n\n### Patch\nTo fix the bug, we need to modify the regex pattern to allow attribute names to end with a question mark. The updated pattern should be `\\w+?\\?:(?!:)`, which allows for an optional `?` at the end of the attribute name.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-elixir.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'attr-name': /\\w+:(?!:)/,\n=======\n'attr-name': /\\w+?\\?:(?!:)/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch updates the regex pattern to correctly identify attribute names that may end with a question mark, ensuring proper syntax highlighting for Elixir code."
