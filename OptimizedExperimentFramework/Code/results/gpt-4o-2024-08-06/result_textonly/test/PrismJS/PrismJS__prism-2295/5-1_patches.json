    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that single-package package names in Java are highlighted correctly. The problem seems to be that the current implementation does not handle single-package names properly, which are not being highlighted as expected.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image shows a Java code snippet where the package declaration `package baz;` is not highlighted. This indicates that the current syntax highlighting logic does not recognize single-word package names as valid namespaces, which should be highlighted.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe bug is likely located in the `components/prism-java.js` file, specifically in the section where namespaces are defined. The current regex pattern for namespaces seems to expect at least one dot in the package name, which would exclude single-word package names like `baz`.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the regex pattern for namespaces to allow single-word package names. The current pattern is:\n\n```javascript\npattern: /(\\\\b(?:exports|import(?:\\\\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\\\\s+)[a-z]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.[a-z]\\\\w*)+/,\n```\n\nWe need to adjust this pattern to also match single-word package names. Here is the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-java.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\npattern: /(\\\\b(?:exports|import(?:\\\\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\\\\s+)[a-z]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.[a-z]\\\\w*)+/,\n=======\npattern: /(\\\\b(?:exports|import(?:\\\\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\\\\s+)[a-z]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.[a-z]\\\\w*)*/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The original pattern required at least one dot in the package name, which is why single-word package names were not being highlighted.\n- The modified pattern removes the requirement for a dot, allowing single-word package names to be matched and highlighted correctly."
