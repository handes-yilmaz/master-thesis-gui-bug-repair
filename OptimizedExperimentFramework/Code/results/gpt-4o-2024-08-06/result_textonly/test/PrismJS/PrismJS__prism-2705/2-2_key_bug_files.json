        "explanation": "The files 'components/prism-javascript.js' and 'components/prism-javascript.min.js' are responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript in PrismJS. The bug report indicates that the issue is related to how template literals are parsed and highlighted. The compressed content of these files shows that they contain the definitions for handling JavaScript syntax, including template strings and regex patterns. Since the bug is about incorrect parsing of template literals after a specific sequence, these files are likely where the parsing logic needs to be corrected to handle the described scenario properly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a syntax highlighting issue in JavaScript and TypeScript code when using PrismJS. The problem arises when a specific sequence of code is present: a regex with a single quote, followed by a comment with a template literal, and then a basic template literal. This sequence causes the template literal parsing to break, leading to incorrect highlighting for the rest of the file."
