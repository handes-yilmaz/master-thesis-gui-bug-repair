    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that the problem arises from the incorrect parsing of template literals in JavaScript, particularly when certain conditions are met in the code. The issue seems to be related to the handling of template literals and comments within the PrismJS syntax highlighting library.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves:\n1. A regex pattern containing a single quote followed by a template literal.\n2. A comment containing a template literal.\n3. A subsequent template literal that breaks the syntax highlighting.\n\nThe root cause appears to be related to the handling of template literals and comments in the PrismJS language definition for JavaScript. The issue likely stems from the way template literals are parsed, especially when they appear after certain patterns.\n\n### Bug Localization\nThe relevant code snippet from `components/prism-javascript.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript, including template literals. The section of interest is the definition of the `template-string` pattern and its handling of interpolation.\n\n### Patch Generation\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the template literals are correctly parsed, even when they appear after comments or regex patterns. We will adjust the `template-string` pattern to handle these cases more robustly.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-javascript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'template-string': {\n    pattern: /`(?:\\\\[\\s\\S]|\\${(?:[^{}]|{(?:[^{}]|{[^}]*})*})+}|(?!\\${)[^\\\\`])*`/,\n    greedy: true,\n    inside: {\n        'template-punctuation': {\n            pattern: /^`|`$/,\n            alias: 'string'\n        },\n        'interpolation': {\n            pattern: /((?:^|[^\\\\])(?:\\\\{2})*)\\${(?:[^{}]|{(?:[^{}]|{[^}]*})*})+}/,\n            lookbehind: true,\n            inside: {\n                'interpolation-punctuation': {\n                    pattern: /^\\${|}$/,\n                    alias: 'punctuation'\n                },\n                rest: Prism.languages.javascript\n            }\n        },\n        'string': /[\\s\\S]+/\n    }\n}\n=======\n'template-string': {\n    pattern: /`(?:\\\\[\\s\\S]|\\${(?:[^{}]|{(?:[^{}]|{[^}]*})*})+}|(?!\\${)[^\\\\`])*`/,\n    greedy: true,\n    inside: {\n        'template-punctuation': {\n            pattern: /^`|`$/,\n            alias: 'string'\n        },\n        'interpolation': {\n            pattern: /((?:^|[^\\\\])(?:\\\\{2})*)\\${(?:[^{}]|{(?:[^{}]|{[^}]*})*})+}/,\n            lookbehind: true,\n            inside: {\n                'interpolation-punctuation': {\n                    pattern: /^\\${|}$/,\n                    alias: 'punctuation'\n                },\n                rest: Prism.languages.javascript\n            }\n        },\n        'string': {\n            pattern: /[\\s\\S]+/,\n            inside: {\n                'comment': /\\/\\/.*|\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\//,\n                'regex': /\\/(?:\\\\.|[^\\/\\\\\\r\\n])+\\/[gimyus]{0,6}/\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `template-string` pattern is adjusted to ensure that it can handle comments and regex patterns within the template literals.\n- The `string` pattern inside the `template-string` now includes handling for comments and regex patterns, ensuring that these elements do not disrupt the parsing of subsequent template literals.\n\nThis patch should address the issue by ensuring that template literals are correctly parsed, even when they follow specific patterns that previously caused issues."
