    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that YAML strings are correctly highlighted even when they have trailing comments. The problem arises because the current regex patterns in the `prism-yaml.js` file do not account for comments following strings on the same line.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image shows a YAML code snippet where a string is followed by a comment on the same line. The string \"world\" is not highlighted correctly due to the presence of the comment \"# test\". This indicates that the regex pattern for strings does not handle trailing comments properly.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe issue is likely in the `string` pattern within the `prism-yaml.js` file. The current regex pattern for strings does not consider the possibility of a comment following a string on the same line. We need to modify this pattern to ensure that strings are correctly highlighted even when followed by comments.\n\n### Patch Generation\nWe will update the `string` pattern in the `prism-yaml.js` file to account for trailing comments. The updated pattern will ensure that strings are highlighted correctly even when they are followed by comments.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-yaml.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': {\n    pattern: /([:\\-,[{]\\s*(?:![^\\s]+)?[ \\t]*)(\"|\\')(?:(?!\\2)[^\\\\\\r\\n]|\\\\.)*\\2(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}))/m,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n},\n=======\n'string': {\n    pattern: /([:\\-,[{]\\s*(?:![^\\s]+)?[ \\t]*)(\"|\\')(?:(?!\\2)[^\\\\\\r\\n]|\\\\.)*\\2(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}|#))/m,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The original `string` pattern checks for strings followed by spaces, end of line, or punctuation. However, it does not account for comments.\n- The updated pattern includes `#` in the lookahead assertion, allowing the regex to recognize strings followed by comments on the same line.\n- This change ensures that strings are highlighted correctly even when they have trailing comments, resolving the issue described in the bug report."
