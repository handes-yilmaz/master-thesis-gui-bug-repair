        "explanation": "The 'Prism.languages' namespace in 'prism.js' is responsible for holding all currently loaded languages and provides helper functions to create and modify language definitions. To add support for a new language such as 'Mermaid', this part of the code would need to be extended to include the grammar and rules for 'Mermaid'. The function 'loadLanguages' in 'components/index.js' is responsible for loading and adding new languages to the current instance. This function would need to include logic for recognizing 'Mermaid' and correctly loading its syntax rules, ensuring that it can be rendered correctly. These areas are directly related to the bug, as they control the recognition and loading of languages in the system, which is necessary to support 'Mermaid' diagrams.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves adding language support for 'Mermaid', a text-based language for creating diagrams, to an existing syntax highlighting tool. The provided example of a 'Mermaid' diagram needs to be supported by the tool, allowing its syntax to be rendered into a visual diagram representation."

        "explanation": "The `loadLanguages` function in `components/index.js` is responsible for loading language definitions and adding them to the system. This function currently loads languages defined in the `components.languages` object, as indicated by the logic that filters out non-meta languages and loads them using a loader. To add support for Mermaid, modifications to this function would be necessary to include Mermaid as a recognized language. Additionally, the function checks for valid languages and logs warnings if a language does not exist. Therefore, extending this function to support Mermaid will involve ensuring that Mermaid is correctly recognized and loaded by the system.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates a need to add support for the Mermaid language, which is used for creating diagrams using text and code. The example provided shows a flowchart defined in Mermaid syntax. The report suggests that the current system does not support this language, and thus, it cannot render diagrams written in Mermaid syntax."
