        "explanation": "1. `components/index.js` and `components.js`: These files are likely responsible for managing the language components in the project. If a new language is to be supported, such as Mermaid, these files will need updates to include the definitions and configurations for highlighting Mermaid syntax.\n2. `prism.js`: This is the main file of the Prism highlighting library. To implement a new language support like Mermaid, you need to ensure that Prism's core is updated to recognize and process the Mermaid syntax. This would typically involve adding grammar definitions and potentially extending or modifying Prism's capabilities to correctly tokenize and render Mermaid code blocks.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates a request to add language support for Mermaid in a project. Mermaid is used to create diagrams using text and code, which can be rendered into visual representations such as flowcharts."

        ],
        "explanation": "The components directory likely contains the individual language definitions, with each language having its own file like prism-java.js, prism-python.js, etc. We would expect to see a 'prism-mermaid.js' file in this directory after the implementation of Mermaid support. The components/index.js file might be responsible for exporting or registering the available language definitions, and thus would need updating to recognize Mermaid. The components.js file seems like another central file where components could be managed or initialized, also requiring modification to include Mermaid language support. Finally, the prism.js file is typically the core script in a PrismJS setup that kicks off the language highlighting, so it may require updates to handle any new syntax rules or logic needed for Mermaid rendering.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report mentions the need to add language support for \"Mermaid\", a language for creating diagrams, which is currently not supported in the codebase."
