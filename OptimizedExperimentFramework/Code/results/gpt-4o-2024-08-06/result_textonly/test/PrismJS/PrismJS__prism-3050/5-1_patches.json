    "1/1": "To address the issue of adding language support for Mermaid in the provided code snippets, we need to make modifications to the `prism.js` and `components/index.js` files. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\nThe bug report indicates a need to add support for the Mermaid language in the Prism library. Mermaid is a language used for creating diagrams using text and code. The current code does not include Mermaid as a supported language, which is why it needs to be added.\n\n### Bug Localization\n1. **`prism.js`**: This file contains the core logic for language definitions and highlighting. We need to ensure that Mermaid is recognized as a language and that its grammar is defined.\n2. **`components/index.js`**: This file manages the loading of languages. We need to ensure that Mermaid can be loaded as a language.\n\n### Patches\n\n#### 1. `prism.js`\nWe need to add a grammar definition for Mermaid. This involves defining the tokens and syntax that Prism will use to highlight Mermaid code.\n\n```javascript\n### prism.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\tToken: Token\n\\t};\n\\t_self.Prism = _;\n=======\n\\t\\tToken: Token\n\\t};\n\n\\t// Add Mermaid language support\n\\tPrism.languages.mermaid = {\n\\t\\t'diagram': {\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(?:graph|sequenceDiagram|classDiagram|stateDiagram|gantt|pie|journey|erDiagram)[^;]*;/,\n\\t\\t\\tinside: {\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'keyword': /\\b(?:graph|sequenceDiagram|classDiagram|stateDiagram|gantt|pie|journey|erDiagram)\\b/,\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'punctuation': /[{}[\\];(),.:]/,\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'operator': /-->|---|==>|==|->|--|==|->>|->|<-|<--|<==|<==>/,\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'entity': /\\b[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*\\b/\n\\t\\t\\t}\n\\t\\t}\n\\t};\n\n\\t_self.Prism = _;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n#### 2. `components/index.js`\nWe need to ensure that the Mermaid language can be loaded by the `loadLanguages` function.\n\n```javascript\n### components/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\tconst pathToLanguage = './prism-' + lang;\n=======\n\\t\\tconst pathToLanguage = lang === 'mermaid' ? './prism-mermaid' : './prism-' + lang;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **`prism.js`**: We added a new language definition for Mermaid. This includes a basic pattern to match Mermaid diagrams and some basic token definitions for keywords, punctuation, operators, and entities.\n- **`components/index.js`**: We modified the path resolution logic to handle the Mermaid language specifically, ensuring that it can be loaded correctly.\n\nThese changes should enable the Prism library to recognize and highlight Mermaid code, addressing the issue described in the bug report."
