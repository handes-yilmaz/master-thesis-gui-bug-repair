    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the JSX syntax highlighting, particularly the handling of spread operators within JSX tags. The problem arises because the current implementation does not correctly handle the spread operator syntax, which leads to incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\n1. **Prism's Broken Syntax Highlighting Image**: This image shows that the syntax highlighting is incorrect when using the spread operator within JSX components. The colors are not applied correctly, indicating that the syntax parser is not recognizing the spread operator as part of the JSX syntax.\n\n2. **Github's Correct Syntax Highlighting Image**: This image demonstrates the correct syntax highlighting, where the spread operator is recognized, and the colors are applied correctly. This suggests that the issue lies in the way the Prism library is parsing the JSX syntax.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is the incorrect handling of the spread operator within JSX tags in the Prism library. The current regex pattern does not account for the spread operator syntax, leading to incorrect tokenization and, consequently, incorrect syntax highlighting.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch Generation\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-jsx.js` file, specifically in the regex patterns used to tokenize JSX syntax. We need to ensure that the spread operator is correctly recognized and tokenized.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-jsx.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('inside', 'attr-name', {\n\t'spread': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\{\\s*\\.\\.\\.\\s*[a-z_$][\\w$]*(?:\\.[a-z_$][\\w$]*)*\\s*\\}/,\n\t\tinside: {\n\t\t\t'punctuation': /\\.\\.\\.|[{}.]/,\n\t\t\t'attr-value': /\\w+/\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, Prism.languages.jsx.tag);\n=======\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('inside', 'attr-name', {\n\t'spread': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\{\\s*\\.\\.\\.\\s*[a-z_$][\\w$]*(?:\\.[a-z_$][\\w$]*)*\\s*\\}/,\n\t\tinside: {\n\t\t\t'punctuation': /\\.\\.\\.|[{}.]/,\n\t\t\t'attr-value': {\n\t\t\t\tpattern: /[a-z_$][\\w$]*/,\n\t\t\t\talias: 'variable'\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, Prism.languages.jsx.tag);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n- **Search Block**: The existing code block that defines the pattern for the spread operator within JSX tags.\n- **Replace Block**: The updated code block that includes an alias for the `attr-value` pattern within the spread operator. This ensures that the spread operator is correctly recognized as a variable, which should improve the syntax highlighting.\n\nBy applying this patch, the Prism library should correctly tokenize the spread operator within JSX components, leading to correct syntax highlighting as demonstrated in the GitHub image."
