    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that interpolation within regex patterns wrapped with `/.../` is correctly highlighted in Ruby. The current implementation only highlights interpolation correctly for `%r{...}` patterns. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify the necessary changes.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**:\n   - The bug report indicates that interpolation within regex patterns using the `/.../` syntax is not highlighted correctly in Ruby. However, it works correctly for `%r{...}` syntax.\n\n2. **Root Cause**:\n   - The existing code in `components/prism-ruby.js` handles regex patterns but does not account for interpolation within `/.../` regex patterns. The interpolation is only handled for `%r{...}` patterns.\n\n3. **Solution**:\n   - We need to modify the regex pattern that matches `/.../` to include interpolation handling, similar to how it is done for `%r{...}`.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch\n\nLet's locate the relevant section in the `components/prism-ruby.js` file and create a patch to fix the issue.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-ruby.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n{\n    pattern: /(^|[^/])\\/(?!\\/)(?:\\[[^\\r\\n\\]]+\\]|\\\\.|[^[/\\\\\\r\\n])+\\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\\s*(?:$|[\\r\\n,.;})]))/,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n}\n=======\n{\n    pattern: /(^|[^/])\\/(?!\\/)(?:\\[[^\\r\\n\\]]+\\]|\\\\.|#\\{[^}]+\\}|[^[/\\\\#\\r\\n])+\\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\\s*(?:$|[\\r\\n,.;})]))/,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true,\n    inside: {\n        'interpolation': interpolation\n    }\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- **Search Block**: The original regex pattern for `/.../` does not account for interpolation. It matches regex patterns but ignores the `#{...}` interpolation syntax.\n  \n- **Replace Block**: The updated pattern includes `#\\{[^}]+\\}` to match interpolation within `/.../` regex patterns. Additionally, the `inside` property is added to handle the interpolation using the existing `interpolation` object.\n\nThis patch ensures that interpolation within `/.../` regex patterns is highlighted correctly, similar to `%r{...}` patterns, thus resolving the issue described in the bug report."
