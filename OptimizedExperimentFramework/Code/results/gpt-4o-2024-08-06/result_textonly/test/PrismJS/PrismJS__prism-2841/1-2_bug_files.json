        "explanation": "The relevant files for addressing this bug are likely `components/prism-ruby.js` and `components/prism-regex.js`. These files are responsible for handling the syntax highlighting for Ruby and regular expressions in general. Since the bug concerns Ruby-specific regex interpolation not being highlighted, `prism-ruby.js` is directly related. Additionally, `prism-regex.js` might contain the logic for regex handling across languages, providing necessary functionality that might be incorrectly implemented or overlooked for Ruby interpolation handling.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that when using Ruby, interpolation within a regex wrapped with `/.../` is not highlighted correctly, whereas when using `%r{...}`, it is highlighted properly. The issue involves the syntax highlighting of interpolated regex patterns specifically for Ruby, leading to inconsistency in the visual presentation for developers when viewing their code."

        "bug_files": [
            "components/prism-ruby.js",
            "components/prism-clike.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is specific to the Ruby language, thus making the `prism-ruby.js` file a primary suspect for the fix because it handles the syntax highlighting for Ruby. Ruby's syntax, including interpolation, is often built upon the `prism-clike.js` file since many language definitions use it as a base to handle common C-like syntax structures. Therefore, updates to handle interpolation within `/.../` style regex would likely require changes to these files.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue in highlighting interpolation in regular expressions for Ruby language within the Prism.js syntax highlighter. Normally, Prism.js should visually distinguish syntax elements like string interpolation within regular expressions. The report indicates that while using `%r` for regex, interpolation is correctly highlighted, but when using the traditional `/.../`, it fails to highlight the interpolation."
