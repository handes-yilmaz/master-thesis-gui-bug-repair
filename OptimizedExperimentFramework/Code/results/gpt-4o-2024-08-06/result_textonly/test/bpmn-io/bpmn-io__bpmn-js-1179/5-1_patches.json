    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that dropping an element onto a sequence flow breaks the layout, with the docking of the new incoming sequence flow always defaulting to the top left corner. This suggests that the calculation of the docking point or the handling of waypoints might be incorrect.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**: The bug scenario involves dropping an element onto a sequence flow, which results in the layout being broken. The docking point for the new sequence flow is incorrectly set, causing the layout to appear broken.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The root cause seems to be related to the calculation of the docking point when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow. The code responsible for this is likely in the `insertShape` function, where the intersection and docking point are calculated.\n\n3. **Code Analysis**: In the `insertShape` function, the docking point is determined by the intersection of the waypoints and the position. If the intersection is not handled correctly, it could lead to the docking point defaulting to an incorrect position, such as the top left corner.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the docking point is calculated correctly and that the waypoints are adjusted appropriately. The following patch addresses this by ensuring that the docking point is set correctly and that the waypoints are adjusted to prevent the layout from breaking.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : position;\n\n      // if last waypointBefore is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {\n        waypointsBefore.push(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n\n      // if first waypointAfter is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {\n        waypointsAfter.unshift(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n=======\n      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : getMid(shape);\n\n      // if last waypointBefore is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {\n        waypointsBefore.push(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n\n      // if first waypointAfter is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsAfter[0])) {\n        waypointsAfter.unshift(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n\n- **Change in Docking Point Calculation**: The docking point is now calculated using `getMid(shape)` instead of `position` when there is no bendpoint. This ensures that the docking point is centered on the shape, preventing it from defaulting to the top left corner.\n- **Waypoint Adjustment**: The logic for adjusting waypoints remains the same, ensuring that the docking point is only added if necessary, based on the shape's bounds.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that the docking point is correctly calculated and that the sequence flow layout remains intact after dropping an element."
