    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the error. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to read the `segmentIndex` property of an undefined object, which suggests that the code is not handling a case where the expected object is not present.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug occurs when inserting a gateway onto a flow, causing the editor to crash with a `TypeError`. The error trace points to `LabelLayoutUtil.js` and `LabelBehavior.js` as the locations where the error is triggered. The issue seems to be related to the handling of label adjustments when the connection waypoints are updated.\n\n### Root Cause\nThe root cause of the error is likely due to the `getAttachment` function returning `undefined` when it fails to find a valid attachment point for the label. This results in an attempt to access `segmentIndex` on an undefined object in the `getLabelAdjustment` function.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `getLabelAdjustment` function in `LabelLayoutUtil.js`. We need to ensure that the `attachment` object is valid before attempting to access its properties.\n\n### Patch\nWe will add a check to ensure that `attachment` is defined before accessing `attachment.segmentIndex`. If `attachment` is undefined, we should return a default adjustment of `{ x: 0, y: 0 }`.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/LabelLayoutUtil.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  var attachment = getAttachment(labelPosition, oldWaypoints),\n      oldLabelLineIndex = attachment.segmentIndex,\n      newLabelLineIndex = findNewLabelLineStartIndex(oldWaypoints, newWaypoints, attachment, hints);\n\n  if (newLabelLineIndex === null) {\n    return { x: x, y: y };\n  }\n=======\n  var attachment = getAttachment(labelPosition, oldWaypoints);\n\n  if (!attachment) {\n    return { x: x, y: y };\n  }\n\n  var oldLabelLineIndex = attachment.segmentIndex,\n      newLabelLineIndex = findNewLabelLineStartIndex(oldWaypoints, newWaypoints, attachment, hints);\n\n  if (newLabelLineIndex === null) {\n    return { x: x, y: y };\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the code checks for a valid `attachment` object before proceeding with further calculations, thus preventing the `TypeError` from occurring."
