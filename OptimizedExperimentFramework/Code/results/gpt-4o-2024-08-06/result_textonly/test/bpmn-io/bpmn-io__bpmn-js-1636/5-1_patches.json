    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that when morphing a call activity to an expanded subprocess, a start event is automatically added. The bug report indicates that this behavior is currently missing, leading to a confusing user experience.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario images and description suggest that when a call activity is morphed into an expanded subprocess, it should automatically include a start event, similar to the behavior when morphing from a task. The absence of this start event results in a subprocess that visually resembles a task, which is not the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is likely in the logic that handles the morphing of elements, specifically when a call activity is transformed into an expanded subprocess. The code responsible for adding a start event during this transformation is either missing or not being executed correctly.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe relevant code snippets provided are from two files: `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js` and `BpmnReplace.js`. The `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js` file contains logic for adding a start event when an element is replaced with an expanded subprocess. However, it currently only checks if the old shape is a task. We need to extend this logic to include call activities as well.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (\n      !is(newShape, 'bpmn:SubProcess') ||\n      !is(oldShape, 'bpmn:Task') ||\n      !isExpanded(newShape)\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n=======\n    if (\n      !is(newShape, 'bpmn:SubProcess') ||\n      (!is(oldShape, 'bpmn:Task') && !is(oldShape, 'bpmn:CallActivity')) ||\n      !isExpanded(newShape)\n    ) {\n      return;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Modification in `SubProcessStartEventBehavior.js`:** The condition that checks the type of the old shape is expanded to include `bpmn:CallActivity` in addition to `bpmn:Task`. This ensures that when a call activity is morphed into an expanded subprocess, the logic to add a start event is triggered, thereby fixing the bug.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that a start event is added when morphing a call activity to an expanded subprocess, aligning the behavior with the expected UX."
