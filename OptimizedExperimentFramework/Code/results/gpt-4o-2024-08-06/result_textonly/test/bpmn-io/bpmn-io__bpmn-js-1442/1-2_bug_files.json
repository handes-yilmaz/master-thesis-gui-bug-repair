        "explanation": "The file `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` is directly mentioned in the bug report and is part of the modeling behaviors that handle how elements are placed on flows in BPMN diagrams. Given the issue is specifically about how multiple tasks are connected when dropped on a sequence flow, any unexpected behavior likely involves logic within this file.\n\nThe `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file is related because it controls the copying and pasting functions within the BPMN model. Since the bug involves copying tasks and pasting them onto a sequence flow, there may be a problem with how paste actions are processed or how connections are (re)established post-paste. Both these areas would be relevant when diagnosing and fixing the bug. Changes in either file could address how multiple pasted elements interact with existing pathways, ensuring they connect correctly or as per expected scheme guidelines.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when multiple shapes (tasks) are copied and pasted onto a sequence flow within the BPMN diagramming library (bpmn-js). Instead of behaving as expected, where either no incorrect connections are made or the connections are logically consistent, the tasks are connected in unexpected ways. This behavior is demonstrated in the provided GIF where pasted tasks do not align to the existing workflow as intended."

        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js**: This file is directly mentioned in the bug report under the expected behavior section. The DropOnFlowBehavior is responsible for handling the logic when elements are dropped on a flow. Given the issue involves unexpected connections when multiple shapes are pasted onto a flow, this file likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle multiple elements being dropped correctly.\n\n2. **lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js**: As the problem involves copying and pasting elements, the BpmnCopyPaste module plays a role in how elements are duplicated and potentially positioned or connected when pasted. Any logic that determines how elements should be placed or connected after pasting would likely reside here, making it relevant to addressing the issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario describes an issue where multiple shape elements are pasted onto a sequence flow, which results in unexpected connections between these elements. In the scenario, the behavior related to how shapes are connected when dropped or pasted onto a flow doesn't function as intended when multiple shapes are involved. The expected behavior would be either no automatic connection behavior for multiple shapes or a sensible connection format that logically aligns the pasted elements along the sequence flow."
