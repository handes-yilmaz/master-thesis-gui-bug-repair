    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The bug report indicates that when multiple shapes are pasted onto a connection, unexpected connections are formed. The expected behavior is that either the behavior doesn't activate for multiple shapes or it connects them in a logical manner.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario image shows that when two tasks are pasted onto a sequence flow, they are connected in an unexpected manner. This suggests that the logic handling the insertion of shapes onto flows does not correctly handle multiple shapes.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\nThe root cause likely lies in the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file, specifically in the logic that handles the insertion of shapes onto flows. The current implementation seems to handle only a single shape at a time, which results in unexpected behavior when multiple shapes are involved.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe relevant code is in the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file, particularly in the `insertShape` function and the event handlers for `elements.move` and `shape.create`. These functions and handlers are responsible for determining how shapes are inserted onto flows and how connections are made.\n\n### Patches\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the logic correctly handles multiple shapes. This involves iterating over all shapes and applying the insertion logic to each one individually.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  this.postExecuted('elements.move', function(context) {\n\n    var shapes = context.shapes,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        position = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      insertShape(shapes[0], targetFlow, position);\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n=======\n  this.postExecuted('elements.move', function(context) {\n\n    var shapes = context.shapes,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        position = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      shapes.forEach(function(shape) {\n        insertShape(shape, targetFlow, position);\n      });\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  this.postExecuted('shape.create', function(context) {\n\n    var shape = context.shape,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        positionOrBounds = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      insertShape(shape, targetFlow, positionOrBounds);\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n=======\n  this.postExecuted('shape.create', function(context) {\n\n    var shapes = context.shapes,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        positionOrBounds = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      shapes.forEach(function(shape) {\n        insertShape(shape, targetFlow, positionOrBounds);\n      });\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `postExecuted` handlers for `elements.move` and `shape.create` have been modified to iterate over all shapes in the `shapes` array. This ensures that each shape is individually inserted onto the target flow, preventing unexpected connections when multiple shapes are involved.\n- The `insertShape` function is called for each shape, allowing the logic to handle each shape separately and connect them in a logical manner."
