    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the \"illegal invocation\" error that occurs when an element is deleted while direct editing is active. The error is likely due to the `directEditing` module not properly handling the cancellation of editing when an element is removed.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves deleting an element while direct editing is active, which triggers an \"illegal invocation\" exception. This suggests that the direct editing session is not being properly terminated or cleaned up when the element is removed, leading to an attempt to update or access a non-existent element.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely in the `LabelEditingProvider.js` file, where the direct editing session is not being properly canceled when an element is removed. The `directEditing.cancel()` method should be invoked to ensure that any active editing session is terminated when an element is deleted.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe relevant code snippet in `LabelEditingProvider.js` already contains an event listener for `shape.remove` and `connection.remove` events, which calls `directEditing.cancel()`. However, the condition `directEditing.isActive(event.element)` might be incorrect, as it checks if the specific element is being edited, rather than if any direct editing session is active.\n\n### Proposed Patch\nWe need to modify the condition to check if any direct editing session is active, not just for the specific element being removed. This ensures that the direct editing session is canceled regardless of which element is being edited.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\neventBus.on([\n  'shape.remove',\n  'connection.remove'\n], function(event) {\n\n  if (directEditing.isActive(event.element)) {\n    directEditing.cancel();\n  }\n});\n=======\neventBus.on([\n  'shape.remove',\n  'connection.remove'\n], function(event) {\n\n  if (directEditing.isActive()) {\n    directEditing.cancel();\n  }\n});\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the direct editing session is canceled whenever an element is removed, preventing the \"illegal invocation\" error from occurring."
