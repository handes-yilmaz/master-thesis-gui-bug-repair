    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that labels are correctly copied and pasted along with the elements in the BPMN diagram. The bug report suggests that the labels are lost during the copy-paste operation, which is likely due to the handling of labels in the `BpmnCopyPaste` module.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves copying participant contents from a BPMN diagram and pasting them back, resulting in missing labels. The root cause is likely related to the handling of labels during the copy-paste process, specifically in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file. The `isLabel` function is used to determine if an element is a label, and the handling of labels during the paste operation seems to be incorrect or incomplete.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue is likely in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file, where the `copyElement` and `pasteElement` events are handled. We need to ensure that labels are correctly associated with their elements during the paste operation.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {\n    var cache = context.cache,\n        descriptor = context.descriptor,\n        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,\n        newBusinessObject;\n\n    // do NOT copy business object if external label\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);\n\n      return;\n    }\n\n    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);\n\n    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(\n      oldBusinessObject,\n      newBusinessObject\n    );\n\n    // resolve references e.g. default sequence flow\n    resolveReferences(descriptor);\n\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, 'isExpanded');\n\n    removeProperties(descriptor, 'oldBusinessObject');\n  });\n=======\n  eventBus.on('copyPaste.pasteElement', function(context) {\n    var cache = context.cache,\n        descriptor = context.descriptor,\n        oldBusinessObject = descriptor.oldBusinessObject,\n        newBusinessObject;\n\n    // handle label elements\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);\n      setLabel(descriptor, oldBusinessObject.name || '', true);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);\n\n    descriptor.businessObject = moddleCopy.copyElement(\n      oldBusinessObject,\n      newBusinessObject\n    );\n\n    // resolve references e.g. default sequence flow\n    resolveReferences(descriptor);\n\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, 'isExpanded');\n\n    removeProperties(descriptor, 'oldBusinessObject');\n  });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The patch modifies the `pasteElement` event handler in `BpmnCopyPaste.js`.\n- It ensures that when a label is detected (`isLabel(descriptor)`), the label text is set using the `setLabel` function.\n- This ensures that the label text is preserved and correctly associated with the element during the paste operation.\n\nThis patch should address the issue of labels being lost during the copy-paste process in the BPMN diagram."
