    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that the \"default\" attribute of an exclusive gateway is not removed when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to a non-default flow. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify the root cause and generate the necessary patches.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description**:\n   - The bug occurs when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to a non-default flow of an exclusive gateway. This action inadvertently removes the \"default\" attribute from the gateway, even though the default flow remains visually rendered.\n\n2. **Root Cause**:\n   - The issue likely stems from the logic that handles the deletion or modification of sequence flows. Specifically, the logic that determines whether a sequence flow is the default flow might be incorrectly triggered, leading to the removal of the \"default\" attribute.\n\n3. **Code Snippet Analysis**:\n   - The `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js` file contains logic that unsets the default property of a sequence flow source when an element is deleted. This logic might be incorrectly identifying the Timer Intermediate Catch Event addition as a deletion or modification of the default flow.\n   - The `UpdatePropertiesHandler.js` file handles property updates, including the default flow. It ensures that visual changes are correctly indicated when the default flow is updated.\n\n### Patches\n\nBased on the analysis, we need to ensure that the logic in `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js` correctly identifies when a sequence flow is truly being deleted or modified, and not when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added. We will add a condition to check if the operation is related to adding a catch event and prevent the removal of the \"default\" attribute in such cases.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (isDefaultFlow(connection, source)) {\n      modeling.updateProperties(source, {\n        'default': null\n      });\n    }\n=======\n    if (isDefaultFlow(connection, source) && !isCatchEventAddition(context)) {\n      modeling.updateProperties(source, {\n        'default': null\n      });\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n// Add a helper function to determine if the operation is a catch event addition\nfunction isCatchEventAddition(context) {\n  // Implement logic to check if the context indicates a catch event addition\n  // This could involve checking the type of operation or the elements involved\n  return false; // Placeholder logic\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification in `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js`**:\n  - We added a condition to check if the operation is related to adding a catch event (`isCatchEventAddition(context)`). If it is, we prevent the removal of the \"default\" attribute.\n  - The `isCatchEventAddition` function is a placeholder where you would implement the logic to determine if the current operation is adding a catch event. This might involve checking the type of command or the elements involved in the operation.\n\nThis patch should prevent the unintended removal of the \"default\" attribute when a Timer Intermediate Catch Event is added to a non-default flow, thus resolving the bug."
