        "explanation": "1. **BpmnRules.js**: This file is most likely responsible for defining the rules that govern connections and flow between elements in a BPMN diagram. Since the bug describes a rule violation where a message flow can incorrectly target a boundary event, this file would need to be examined and potentially modified to include a rule that disallows such connections.\n\n2. **BoundaryEventBehavior.js**: Given that the bug specifically involves boundary events, it is probable that this file, which manages the behavior of boundary events, might also require adjustments. Changes in this file could ensure that boundary events reject certain types of connections that are semantically incorrect, such as being a target of message flows.",
        "bug_scenario": "The given bug report describes a scenario where, in a BPMN diagram, it is possible to connect a message flow to a boundary event. According to BPMN semantics, this connection should not be possible, and thus needs to be restricted in the application's logic."

        ],
        "explanation": "The file 'BoundaryEventBehavior.js' is likely responsible for handling the interactions or behaviors associated with boundary events in the BPMN modeling process. Since the bug involves disallowing certain connections (message flows to boundary events), any logic preventing or allowing such behavior needs to be updated here.\n\nThe file 'BpmnRules.js' is essential as it handles the rules for permissible connections and operations within the BPMN modeler. To implement the expected behavior where connections to boundary events are forbidden, modifications would be necessary to update the rules accordingly thereby preventing message flows from being attached to boundary events. This would ensure adherence to BPMN semantics, as outlined in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves ensuring that a message flow cannot be connected to boundary events in a BPMN diagram, as this is not aligned with BPMN semantics. The given image shows an attempt to connect a participant to a boundary event, an operation that should be prohibited by the rules of the BPMN library."
