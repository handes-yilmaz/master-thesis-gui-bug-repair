    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that boundary events cannot be used as targets for message flows. The bug report indicates that this behavior is not currently enforced, which is against BPMN semantics. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify where the changes are needed.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Images**: The image shows an attempt to connect a message flow to a boundary event, which should not be allowed according to BPMN semantics. The connection should be disallowed, but it is currently possible.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The root cause of the bug is that the rules for disallowing message flows to boundary events are not correctly implemented in the code. Specifically, the function `canConnect` in `BpmnRules.js` should be updated to include a check that prevents boundary events from being message flow targets.\n\n### Bug Localization and Fix\n\nWe will focus on the `canConnect` function in `lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js`. This function determines whether a connection between two elements is allowed. We need to modify this function to ensure that boundary events cannot be targets for message flows.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction canConnect(source, target, connection) {\n\n  if (nonExistingOrLabel(source) || nonExistingOrLabel(target)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  if (!is(connection, 'bpmn:DataAssociation')) {\n\n    if (canConnectMessageFlow(source, target)) {\n      return { type: 'bpmn:MessageFlow' };\n    }\n\n    if (canConnectSequenceFlow(source, target)) {\n      return { type: 'bpmn:SequenceFlow' };\n    }\n  }\n=======\nfunction canConnect(source, target, connection) {\n\n  if (nonExistingOrLabel(source) || nonExistingOrLabel(target)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // Disallow message flows to boundary events\n  if (is(target, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent')) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  if (!is(connection, 'bpmn:DataAssociation')) {\n\n    if (canConnectMessageFlow(source, target)) {\n      return { type: 'bpmn:MessageFlow' };\n    }\n\n    if (canConnectSequenceFlow(source, target)) {\n      return { type: 'bpmn:SequenceFlow' };\n    }\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification**: We added a check in the `canConnect` function to return `false` if the target is a boundary event. This ensures that message flows cannot be connected to boundary events, aligning with BPMN semantics.\n- **Context**: The change is made within the `canConnect` function, which is responsible for determining the validity of connections between elements. The added check is placed before any other connection type checks to ensure it takes precedence.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by enforcing the rule that boundary events cannot be message flow targets."
