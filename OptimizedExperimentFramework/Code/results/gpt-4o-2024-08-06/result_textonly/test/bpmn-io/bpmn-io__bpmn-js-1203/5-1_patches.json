    "1/1": "To address the bug where Intermediate Events lose their properties when copied and pasted as Boundary Events, we need to ensure that the properties of the Intermediate Event are preserved during the copy-paste operation. The bug report indicates that properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations are lost when the event is pasted as a Boundary Event.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves copying an Intermediate Event and pasting it as a Boundary Event, which results in the loss of certain properties. The root cause is likely due to the way properties are handled during the copy-paste operation, specifically when the event type changes from an Intermediate Event to a Boundary Event.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue likely resides in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file, where the copy and paste logic is implemented. We need to ensure that all relevant properties are copied from the Intermediate Event to the Boundary Event.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    copyProperties(businessObject, descriptor, 'name');\n=======\n    copyProperties(businessObject, descriptor, ['name', 'asyncBefore', 'asyncAfter', 'jobPriority']);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [\n      'isExpanded',\n      'name'\n    ]);\n=======\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [\n      'isExpanded',\n      'name',\n      'asyncBefore',\n      'asyncAfter',\n      'jobPriority'\n    ]);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Copy Properties**: The `copyProperties` function is used to copy specific properties from the source to the target. We added `asyncBefore`, `asyncAfter`, and `jobPriority` to ensure these properties are copied when the Intermediate Event is transformed into a Boundary Event.\n\n2. **Preserve Properties**: By including these properties in the `copyProperties` calls, we ensure that they are preserved during the copy-paste operation, addressing the bug where these properties were previously lost.\n\nThese changes should ensure that the properties of the Intermediate Event are retained when it is pasted as a Boundary Event, thus fixing the bug as described in the report."
