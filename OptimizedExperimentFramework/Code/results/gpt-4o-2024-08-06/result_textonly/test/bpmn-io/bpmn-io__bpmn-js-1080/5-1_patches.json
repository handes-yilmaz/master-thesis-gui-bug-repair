    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the issue. The problem arises when a pool that previously had more than one lane is reduced to a single lane, and the message flow connection becomes restricted to the pool's header rather than the lane itself.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug scenario involves the following steps:\n1. Creating two pools and connecting them using a message flow.\n2. Adding and then removing a lane from one of the pools.\n3. Attempting to reconnect the pools using a message flow, which only allows connection at the pool's header.\n\nThe root cause of the issue seems to be related to how the lanes are managed and adjusted when a lane is deleted. Specifically, the `DeleteLaneBehavior` and `LaneUtil` modules are responsible for handling lane deletions and adjustments.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue likely stems from the `compensateLaneDelete` function in `DeleteLaneBehavior.js`, which adjusts the positions of sibling lanes when a lane is deleted. However, it does not properly handle the case where a pool is reduced to a single lane, affecting the ability to connect message flows to the lane.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the pool's boundary is correctly updated to reflect the single lane's boundary after a lane is deleted. This involves modifying the `compensateLaneDelete` function to update the pool's boundary appropriately.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DeleteLaneBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (!siblings.length) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var offset;\n\n    if (bottomAffected.length && topAffected.length) {\n      offset = shape.height / 2;\n    } else {\n      offset = shape.height;\n    }\n=======\n    if (!siblings.length) {\n      // Update the pool boundary to match the single lane's boundary\n      modeling.updateBounds(oldParent, {\n        x: oldParent.x,\n        y: shape.y,\n        width: oldParent.width,\n        height: shape.height\n      });\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var offset;\n\n    if (bottomAffected.length && topAffected.length) {\n      offset = shape.height / 2;\n    } else {\n      offset = shape.height;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The patch modifies the `compensateLaneDelete` function to update the pool's boundary when there are no sibling lanes left. This ensures that the pool's boundary matches the single remaining lane's boundary, allowing message flows to connect to the lane rather than just the pool's header.\n\nThis fix should address the issue described in the bug report, allowing message flows to be connected to the pool's boundary even after lanes have been added and removed."
