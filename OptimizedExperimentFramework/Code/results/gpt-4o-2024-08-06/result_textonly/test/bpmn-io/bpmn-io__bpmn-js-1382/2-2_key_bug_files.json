        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/replace/ReplaceOptions.js**: This file likely contains the configuration for the replace options available in the BPMN tool. Since the bug involves adding new options to the replace menu, this file would need to be updated to include the new DataStoreReference and DataObjectReference options.\n\n2. **lib/features/replace/BpmnReplace.js**: This module handles the replacement of BPMN elements. To implement the feature of switching between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference, modifications in this file are necessary to ensure the correct handling and transformation of these elements during the replace operation.\n\n3. **lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js**: This file provides the replace menu in the popup menu. It is responsible for generating the menu entries based on the available replace options. To ensure the new options are displayed in the menu, this file needs to be updated to include logic for the new DataStoreReference and DataObjectReference options.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the DataObjectReference replace menu in a BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) tool. The current menu only contains a collection marker, making it appear empty and out of place. The feature request is to allow switching between a DataObjectReference and a DataStoreReference, ensuring the menu is always populated with relevant options."
