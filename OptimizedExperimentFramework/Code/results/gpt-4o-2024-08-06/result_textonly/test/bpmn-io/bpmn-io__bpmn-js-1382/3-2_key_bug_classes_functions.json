        "explanation": "The 'BpmnReplace.js' file contains the 'replaceElement' function, which is essential for handling the replacement of BPMN elements. This function is directly responsible for the logic of replacing one element with another, making it relevant for implementing the feature request to allow switching between DataObjectReferences and DataStoreReferences. Modifying this function or its surrounding logic will likely be required to support the new replacement options in the menu.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a feature request to enhance the DataObjectReference replace menu in a BPMN modeling tool. The current menu only contains the collection marker and appears empty. The suggestion is to allow DataObjectReferences to be switched to DataStoreReferences and vice-versa, ensuring the menu is always populated."

The function 'replaceElement' within this class handles the logic for replacing elements, making it crucial for implementing the requested feature to switch between element types.\n\nThe class 'ReplaceMenuProvider' in 'lib/features/popup-menu/ReplaceMenuProvider.js' is an element-agnostic replace menu provider, which suggests that it is responsible for managing the options available within the replace menu. This class would need to be modified to include options for DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference, ensuring the menu is always populated with these options.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an enhancement to the DataObjectReference replace menu within a user interface. Currently, this menu only contains the collection marker, making it feel empty and out of place. The enhancement suggestion is to allow switching between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference, ensuring the menu is always populated with relevant options until DataObjectInputs/Outputs are handled."
