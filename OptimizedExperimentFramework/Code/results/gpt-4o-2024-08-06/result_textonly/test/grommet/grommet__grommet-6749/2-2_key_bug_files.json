        "explanation": "1. `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`: This file is the main file for the `DataTable` component. It imports and uses various sub-components like `Header`, `Footer`, `Body`, and `GroupedBody`. The absence of a `DataTableGroup` component suggests that modifications or additions might be needed here to integrate the new component for handling group selections.\n\n2. `src/js/components/DataTable/GroupedBody.js`: This file handles the rendering of grouped data within the `DataTable`. It includes logic for managing group states, such as expansion and selection. The `groupBy` prop is directly referenced here, indicating that this file would need updates to incorporate the new `DataTableGroup` component functionality.\n\n3. `src/js/components/DataTable/Header.js`: This file manages the header of the `DataTable`, which often includes controls for sorting and filtering. Since the `DataTableGroup` component is expected to provide a control for selecting group options, the header might need to be updated to include this new control, making it a relevant file for the bug fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the absence of a `DataTableGroup` component in the `Data` related components. The `DataTableGroup` component is expected to provide a control for selecting the `DataTable groupBy={groupBy}` value, which is currently missing. The provided images illustrate a `Select` component implementation that is intended to serve this purpose, showing a dropdown menu for selecting group options in a data table."
