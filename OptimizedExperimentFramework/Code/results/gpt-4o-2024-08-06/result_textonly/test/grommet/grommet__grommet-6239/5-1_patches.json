    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the tab underlines are sticky and remain at the bottom when there is scrollable content within the tab. The problem seems to have arisen after a recent update, and the bug report suggests that the issue is related to the styling of the tabs.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that the tab underlines are not sticking to the bottom when there is scrollable content. The expected behavior shows the underlines correctly positioned at the bottom, while the actual behavior shows them misaligned. This suggests that the CSS styling for the tabs, particularly the `StyledTabsHeader` or `StyledTabPanel`, might not be correctly handling the layout when content overflows.\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\nThe issue likely resides in the CSS styling of the `StyledTabsHeader` or `StyledTabPanel` components. The `StyledTabsHeader` component is responsible for rendering the tab headers, and any misalignment in its styling could cause the underlines to not stick to the bottom. The `StyledTabPanel` component is responsible for the content area of the tabs, and its styling might also affect the layout.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the CSS styling to ensure that the tab underlines are correctly positioned. We will modify the `StyledTabsHeader` component to ensure that it handles overflow content properly and that the underlines remain at the bottom.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Tabs/StyledTabs.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst StyledTabsHeader = styled.div`\n  ${props => props.theme.tabs.header.extend};\n`;\n=======\nconst StyledTabsHeader = styled.div`\n  ${props => props.theme.tabs.header.extend};\n  position: relative;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  &:after {\n    content: '';\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    right: 0;\n    height: 2px;\n    background-color: ${props => props.theme.global.colors['brand']};\n  }\n`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Positioning and Overflow**: We added `position: relative;` and `overflow: hidden;` to the `StyledTabsHeader` to ensure that the underline is positioned relative to the tab header and that any overflow content is handled correctly.\n- **Underline Styling**: We added a pseudo-element `&:after` to create the underline. This ensures that the underline is always positioned at the bottom of the tab header, regardless of the content overflow.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that the tab underlines are sticky and remain at the bottom when there is scrollable content within the tab."
