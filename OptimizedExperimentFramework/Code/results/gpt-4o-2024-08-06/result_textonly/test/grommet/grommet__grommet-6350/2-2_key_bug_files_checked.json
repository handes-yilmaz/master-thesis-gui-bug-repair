        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/List/List.js**: This file is the main implementation of the List component. It contains logic related to the 'onOrder' property and how it interacts with other properties like 'action'. The comments in the file indicate handling of active states and ordering, which are directly related to the reported issue of misalignment when 'onOrder' is used.\n\n2. **src/js/components/List/stories/Order.js**: This file contains a story that demonstrates the use of the 'onOrder' property. It is crucial for reproducing the bug and understanding how 'onOrder' affects the List component's behavior. The story setup directly relates to the bug scenario described in the report, making it a key file for testing and verifying any fixes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a misalignment issue in a List component when both 'action' and 'onOrder' properties are used together. The expected behavior is for the action to be aligned with the rest of the list, even when the 'onOrder' property is present. However, the actual behavior shows that 'action' and 'onOrder' do not work together, leading to an unaligned list. This is demonstrated in the provided images, where the list appears aligned without 'onOrder' but becomes unaligned when 'onOrder' is added."
