    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `action` property works correctly with the `onOrder` property in the `List` component. The problem is that when both properties are used together, the list items become unaligned.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Images Description:**\n   - **With `onOrder`:** The list items appear unaligned when both `action` and `onOrder` properties are used. The action buttons are not aligned with the list items.\n   - **Without `onOrder`:** The list items are properly aligned when only the `action` property is used without `onOrder`.\n\n2. **Reasoning the Bug Root Causes:**\n   - The misalignment occurs because the `action` property is not being handled correctly when `onOrder` is also present. The layout logic for aligning the list items and actions is likely not considering the additional space or structure needed when `onOrder` is active.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `List.js` file, where the list items and actions are being rendered. The issue likely lies in how the `content` and `boxProps` are being set when both `action` and `onOrder` are present.\n\n### Generate Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the layout logic to ensure that the `action` property is correctly aligned with the list items when `onOrder` is used. This involves modifying the `content` and `boxProps` settings.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/List/List.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if (action) {\n                  content = [\n                    <Box align=\"start\" key={`actionContainer${index}`}>\n                      {content}\n                    </Box>,\n                    action(item, index),\n                  ];\n                  boxProps = {\n                    direction: 'row',\n                    align: secondaryKey ?
