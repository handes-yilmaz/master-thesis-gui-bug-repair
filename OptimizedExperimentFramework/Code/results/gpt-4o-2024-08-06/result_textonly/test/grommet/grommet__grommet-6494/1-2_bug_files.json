        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/FormField/FormField.js:** Since the bug report mentions the FormField component, it's critical to check its styling and layout logic to ensure child components like RangeInput are properly contained and centered.\n\n2. **src/js/components/RangeInput/RangeInput.js:** The issue specifically involves the RangeInput component, so the implementation and styling within this file must be reviewed for any calculations or CSS that might cause it to extend beyond its parent FormField.\n\n3. **src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js:** This file likely contains the specific styled-components CSS affecting the RangeInput. Improper styling here might contribute to the misalignment off-center display issue. Ensuring the CSS allows for proper alignment and containment within a parent FormField is essential.",
        "bug_scenario": "The RangeInput component within a FormField is not centering properly, extending beyond the FormField edges. This misalignment is apparent in both the grommet and hpe themes, being more noticeable in the hpe theme."

        "explanation": "1. **RangeInput.js**: This file likely contains the core functionality and styling for the RangeInput component. Any issue with alignment or sizing would originate from incorrect styles or logic in this file.\n2. **FormField.js**: As the bug involves the RangeInput within a FormField, this file, which manages the FormField, needs to be checked for any conflicts in styling or structure that might cause the RangeInput to appear off-center or mis-sized. \n3. **StyledRangeInput.js**: This file may contain specific styling definitions for the RangeInput component. Misalignments often result from incorrect CSS, which might be defined here.\n4. **hpe.js and grommet.js**: As the issue is manifested differently or more conspicuously under different themes, checking these theme files will help identify if any theme-specific overrides or styles are causing the misalignment of the RangeInput within FormField.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is that the RangeInput component extends beyond the boundaries of the FormField and is not centered, most notably in the HPE theme as depicted in the provided screenshot. The RangeInput is visually misaligned and does not fit well within its parent FormField component."
