    "1/1": "To address the issue of the `RangeInput` being off-center within the `FormField`, we need to ensure that the `RangeInput` is properly styled and contained within the `FormField`. The bug report indicates that the `RangeInput` extends beyond the edge of the `FormField` and is not centered. This issue is likely related to the styling and layout properties applied to the `RangeInput` and its container.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\n1. **Bug Scenario Images**: The image shows that the `RangeInput` is not properly aligned within the `FormField`. It extends beyond the boundaries, indicating a possible issue with padding, margin, or width settings.\n2. **Code Analysis**:\n   - In `FormField.js`, the `FormFieldContentBox` and `FormFieldBox` are used to style the content and container of the form field. The `RangeInput` should be properly contained within these styled components.\n   - In `StyledRangeInput.js`, the `StyledRangeInput` component is responsible for the styling of the `RangeInput`. The width and padding settings here are crucial for ensuring the `RangeInput` fits within its container.\n\n### Bug Fix\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the styling in `StyledRangeInput.js` to ensure the `RangeInput` is properly contained and centered within the `FormField`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 0px;\n=======\n  width: calc(100% - 16px); /* Adjust width to account for padding */\n  padding: 8px; /* Add padding to center the RangeInput */\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Width Adjustment**: The width of the `RangeInput` is adjusted to `calc(100% - 16px)` to account for padding on both sides, ensuring it does not extend beyond the `FormField`.\n- **Padding**: Adding `8px` padding centers the `RangeInput` within its container, aligning it properly within the `FormField`.\n\nThese changes should ensure that the `RangeInput` is centered and contained within the `FormField`, addressing the issue described in the bug report."
