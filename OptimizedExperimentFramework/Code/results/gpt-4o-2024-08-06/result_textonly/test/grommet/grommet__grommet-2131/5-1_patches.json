    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the arrow icon for the Select component is visible on a dark background. The bug report indicates that the arrow icon is not visible, which suggests that the color of the icon is not contrasting enough with the dark background.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Analysis\nThe provided image shows a dropdown component with a dark background, and the arrow icon is not visible. This suggests that the icon's color is too dark or not contrasting enough against the dark background.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely the color assigned to the arrow icon in the Select component. The color might be set to a dark shade that blends with the dark background, making it invisible.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nWe need to locate where the arrow icon's color is defined and ensure it is set to a color that contrasts with the dark background. The relevant files are:\n- `src/js/themes/dark.js`: This file defines the theme colors, including text and icon colors.\n- `src/js/components/Select/Select.js`: This file uses the theme to render the Select component, including the arrow icon.\n- `src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js`: This file defines the SVG for the arrow icon, including its fill color.\n\n### Patches\n\n1. **Update the ArrowDown icon color in `ArrowDown.js` to use a lighter color that contrasts with the dark background.**\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<svg width='10' height='20' fill='rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)' {...props}>\n=======\n<svg width='10' height='20' fill='rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)' {...props}>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n2. **Ensure the Select component uses the correct icon color from the theme in `Select.js`.**\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Select/Select.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<SelectIcon color='brand' size={size} />\n=======\n<SelectIcon color={theme.global.colors.text} size={size} />\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n3. **Verify the theme color settings in `dark.js` to ensure the text color is appropriate for icons.**\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/themes/dark.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nicon: {\n  color: textColor,\n  colors,\n},\n=======\nicon: {\n  color: '#FFFFFF', // Ensure the icon color is set to white for contrast\n  colors,\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes ensure that the arrow icon is visible against a dark background by using a lighter color for the icon, improving its contrast and visibility."
