        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/Select/Select.js**: This file contains the implementation of the Select component, including the rendering of the SelectIcon. The issue might be related to how the icon is styled or rendered, especially in terms of color or theme application.\n\n2. **src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js**: This file defines the ArrowDown icon used in the Select component. The fill color of the SVG is set to 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)', which is likely too dark for a dark background, causing visibility issues.\n\n3. **src/js/themes/dark.js**: This file contains the theme settings for the dark mode, including color definitions. The issue might be resolved by adjusting the icon color in the theme to ensure it contrasts well with the dark background.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a UI issue where the arrow icon for a Select component is not visible when used on a dark background. This is likely due to the color of the icon not providing enough contrast against the dark background, making it difficult to see."
