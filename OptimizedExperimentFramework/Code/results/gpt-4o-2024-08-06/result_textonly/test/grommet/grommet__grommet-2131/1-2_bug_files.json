        "explanation": "The files related to the Select component are likely causing the issue. The main files are in the Select directory, specifically Select.js and SelectContainer.js, which handle the rendering and styling logic of the select control. The arrow icon is probably defined or at least styled here, particularly in the ArrowDown.js file, which appears to be the icon causing the visibility issue. \n\nFurthermore, since the issue is related to the display on a 'dark background', the dark.js theme file is suspected. This file would include theme-specific definitions, such as colors and styling, that may not correctly account for contrast in icon displays. The arrow visibility issue likely arises from a color mismatch in the dark theme, specifically affecting how icons appear on dark color schemes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is described as the arrow icon on a select component not being visible against a dark background. This is visually evidenced by the provided screenshot, which shows a select dropdown interface with an invisible or poorly visible arrow due to the lack of sufficient contrast between the arrow's color and the background."

        ],
        "explanation": "The files related to this bug are primarily within the Select component directory. 'Select.js' and 'SelectContainer.js' are the main files for rendering the Select component and managing its functionality. Any styling or rendering issues with the arrow, such as visibility in different themes, would likely involve these files.\n\nThe 'ArrowDown.js' within the 'icons' directory seems to be the specific file responsible for rendering the arrow icon itself. If the arrow is not visible, there may be an issue with its styling that needs to be adjusted for dark backgrounds.\n\nAdditionally, 'colors.js' in the utils folder may contain color definitions used throughout the components. If the arrow's color needs to dynamically adjust based on the theme (light vs dark background), modifications here may apply to ensure the arrow maintains visibility regardless of the background.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that the arrow icon for the 'Select' component is not visible when using a dark background. The attached image shows a dropdown menu with the arrow icon missing, making it difficult for users to identify the enhanced options available via the dropdown."
