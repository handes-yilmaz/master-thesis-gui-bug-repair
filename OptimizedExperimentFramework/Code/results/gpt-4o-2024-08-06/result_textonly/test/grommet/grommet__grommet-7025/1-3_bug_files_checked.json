        "explanation": "The bug is related to the visibility of the 'Clear Filters' button not appearing with user interaction in the Data Toolbar. To address this issue, files related to data filtering and the toolbar components that manage these filters are likely involved:\n\n1. **src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js** and **index.js**: These files manage the overarching data filters component, which would control the state and visibility of filter interactions.\n\n2. **src/js/components/DataFilter/DataFilter.js** and **index.js**: Each individual filter component is managed here. A 'Clear Filters' button could be linked to resetting states in these files.\n\n3. **src/js/components/DataToolbar/DataToolbar.js** and **index.js**: The toolbar likely contains the UI logic for showing/hiding the filter options, including a potential 'Clear Filters' button feature. This would be where any UI changes are implemented regarding toolbar functionality.\n\nThese files align with the reported issue of missing functionality and would be the primary suspects in addressing the bug where UI elements like 'Clear Filters' need handling.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided Bug Report, it is noted that the 'Clear Filters' button is missing when a user engages with the Data Toolbar components such as Filter, Search, etc., within a Data Table scenario. The expected behavior was that the 'Clear Filters' button should appear in these scenarios, as demonstrated in the given URLs and images. However, upon interaction, this button does not show up, making it unclear how to reset the filters applied."

        ],
        "explanation": "The 'Clear Filters' button is directly related to the functionality of filtering within the Data Toolbar and associated components. Therefore: 1. `src/js/components/Data/Data.js` - This file is likely involved in the overall data management and might need adjustments to integrate or trigger the appropriate actions for the 'Clear Filters' button. 2. `src/js/components/DataToolbar/DataToolbar.js` - The bug report mentions the 'Data Toolbar' which is central to the filtering functionality. This component would need to incorporate or provide support for showing the 'Clear Filters' button. 3. `src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js` - Since 'DataFilters' are directly related to applying or clearing filters, this file is likely responsible for managing filter states and would need to coordinate with the 'Clear Filters' functionality.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Clear Filters' button, which is expected to appear whenever the user interacts with a Data Toolbar component, being missing across the application. This button should be present in the examples given on the HPE Design System templates page, specifically in both the 'Filtering with Select' and 'Filtering with Layer' templates. However, in practice, the users are experiencing a situation where this button does not appear when interacting with filtering options."
