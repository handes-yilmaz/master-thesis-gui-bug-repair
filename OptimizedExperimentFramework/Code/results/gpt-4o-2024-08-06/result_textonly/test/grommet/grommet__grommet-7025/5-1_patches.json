    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the 'Clear Filters' button is visible whenever the user interacts with the Data Toolbar components. The bug report indicates that the 'Clear Filters' button is missing in the actual behavior, which is not aligned with the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Images Description:**\n   - The expected images show a 'Clear Filters' button present in the toolbar when filters are applied.\n   - The actual images show the absence of the 'Clear Filters' button even when filters are applied.\n\n2. **Reasoning the Bug Root Causes:**\n   - The 'Clear Filters' button is conditionally rendered based on the presence of a badge, which indicates that some filters are applied.\n   - The button is not being rendered in the toolbar when it should be, possibly due to incorrect conditions or missing integration in the toolbar.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\n1. **`src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js`:**\n   - The `clearControl` is defined and conditionally rendered based on the `badge` value.\n   - The `clearControl` is included in the `content` when `layer` is true, but it seems to be missing when `drop` is used.\n\n2. **`src/js/components/Data/Data.js`:**\n   - The `DataFilters` component is used with the `drop` prop in the toolbar.\n   - The `clearControl` is not explicitly included in the toolbar content.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `clearControl` is included in the toolbar when the `DataFilters` component is used with the `drop` prop.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  if (drop) {\n    control = (\n      <DropButton\n        id={`${dataId}--filters-control`}\n        tip={tip}\n        aria-label={tip}\n        kind=\"toolbar\"\n        icon={<Filter />}\n        hoverIndicator\n        dropProps={dropProps}\n        dropContent={content}\n        badge={badge}\n        open={showContent}\n        onOpen={() => setShowContent(undefined)}\n        onClose={() => setShowContent(undefined)}\n      />\n    );\n  } else if (layer) {\n=======\n  if (drop) {\n    control = (\n      <DropButton\n        id={`${dataId}--filters-control`}\n        tip={tip}\n        aria-label={tip}\n        kind=\"toolbar\"\n        icon={<Filter />}\n        hoverIndicator\n        dropProps={dropProps}\n        dropContent={content}\n        badge={badge}\n        open={showContent}\n        onOpen={() => setShowContent(undefined)}\n        onClose={() => setShowContent(undefined)}\n      />\n    );\n    clearControl && control.push(clearControl);\n  } else if (layer) {\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the `clearControl` is included in the toolbar when the `DataFilters` component is used with the `drop` prop, making the 'Clear Filters' button visible as expected."
