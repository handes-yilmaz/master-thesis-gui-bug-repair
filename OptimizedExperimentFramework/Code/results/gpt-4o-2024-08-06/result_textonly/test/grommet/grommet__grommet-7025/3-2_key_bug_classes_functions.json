        "explanation": "The 'DataFilters.js' file contains the 'DataFilters' component, which is directly responsible for rendering the filter controls, including the 'Clear Filters' button. The 'clearControl' function in this file is specifically tasked with rendering the 'Clear Filters' button, and its presence is conditional based on the 'badge' state, which might be incorrectly set or not triggering correctly. \n\nThe 'Data.js' file contains the 'Data' component that manages the higher-level state and context, including the 'clearFilters' function, which resets the filters. This function is crucial to the functionality of the 'Clear Filters' button, as it defines the logic for clearing the filters. Thus, both the class and the function within it are related to the bug because they are part of the process that should result in the 'Clear Filters' button being displayed and functional.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Clear Filters' button, which is supposed to appear whenever a user interacts with Data Toolbar components like Filter or Search. However, the button is missing from the UI when these interactions occur, as seen in the provided images."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to how the 'Clear Filters' button is managed in the filtering UI components. The 'DataFilters' component in 'DataFilters.js' is responsible for rendering the filter controls, including the 'Clear Filters' button. The 'clearControl' logic within the 'DataFilters' function determines if the button is displayed. If the 'badge' is not calculated correctly or the control logic does not execute, the button might not appear. Additionally, the 'clearFilters' function in 'Data.js' is directly responsible for clearing the filters and resetting the view. If this function does not properly trigger the UI to update and show the 'Clear Filters' button, it contributes to the bug. Ensuring these components and functions manage the button's visibility and functionality correctly is essential to resolving the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Clear Filters' button not appearing as expected when a user interacts with the Data Toolbar components such as Filter or Search. In the expected behavior, the 'Clear Filters' button should be visible and operable whenever any filtering interaction is initiated by the user. However, the actual behavior shows that this button is missing, which can be confusing for users as they may not know how to clear previously applied filters."
