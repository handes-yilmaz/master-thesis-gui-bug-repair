        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js**: This file contains the implementation of the `DataFilters` component, which is responsible for managing the display and functionality of filters within the application. The code includes logic for rendering the 'Clear Filters' button (`clearControl`) based on the presence of active filters (indicated by the `badge` variable). The issue likely stems from this logic not being triggered correctly when the Data Toolbar components are interacted with, leading to the button not being displayed.\n\n2. **src/js/components/Data/Data.js**: This file manages the overall data context and includes the `DataFilters` component within the toolbar. It also defines the `clearFilters` function, which is crucial for resetting the filters. The problem might be related to how the `DataFilters` component is integrated or how the `clearFilters` function is invoked, affecting the visibility of the 'Clear Filters' button.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'Clear Filters' button not appearing when a user interacts with the Data Toolbar components such as Filter or Search. The expected behavior is for the 'Clear Filters' button to be visible and accessible whenever these interactions occur, as demonstrated in the provided examples from the HPE design system."
