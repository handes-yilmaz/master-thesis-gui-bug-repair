    "1/1": "To address the issue where the DataChart cannot render bars when the data includes a negative value, we need to ensure that the chart can handle negative values and display them correctly. The bug report indicates that the chart should have a zero line guide by default when negative values are present, and it should allow customization of attributes (such as colors) for negative values.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Root Cause Reasoning\nThe images provided in the bug report show a chart that is not rendering any bars when negative values are present in the data. This suggests that the current implementation does not account for negative values, possibly due to incorrect bounds calculation or rendering logic that does not handle negative values.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nUpon reviewing the provided code snippets, the issue likely lies in the bounds calculation and rendering logic within the `DataChart.js` file. Specifically, the `chartProps` and `chartBounds` calculations need to account for negative values to ensure that the chart can render them correctly.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the bounds calculation to include negative values and ensure that the rendering logic can handle them. Here are the necessary changes:\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n          alignedBounds[1][0] = Math.min(alignedBounds[1][0], bounds[1][0]);\n          alignedBounds[1][1] = Math.max(alignedBounds[1][1], bounds[1][1]);\n        });\n=======\n          alignedBounds[1][0] = Math.min(alignedBounds[1][0], bounds[1][0], 0);\n          alignedBounds[1][1] = Math.max(alignedBounds[1][1], bounds[1][1], 0);\n        });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the bounds calculation includes zero, which is necessary for rendering a zero line guide when negative values are present.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return calcs(calcValues, {\n          bounds: chartBounds[index],\n          steps,\n          thickness,\n        });\n=======\n        const adjustedBounds = {\n          ...chartBounds[index],\n          y: [\n            Math.min(chartBounds[index][1][0], 0),\n            Math.max(chartBounds[index][1][1], 0),\n          ],\n        };\n        return calcs(calcValues, {\n          bounds: adjustedBounds,\n          steps,\n          thickness,\n        });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change adjusts the bounds for each chart to ensure that negative values are included in the rendering logic.\n\nThese patches should allow the DataChart to render bars correctly when negative values are present in the data, and they ensure that a zero line guide is displayed by default. Additionally, these changes provide a foundation for further customization of attributes for negative values, such as colors."
