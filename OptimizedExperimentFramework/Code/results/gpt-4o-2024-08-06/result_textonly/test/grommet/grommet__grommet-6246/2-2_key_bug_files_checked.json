        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/DataChart/DataChart.js**: This file is the main component file for the DataChart. It handles the rendering logic for the chart, including how data is processed and displayed. The issue with rendering bars when negative values are present likely stems from how the data is being processed or how the chart is being configured to handle negative values. Adjustments in this file are necessary to ensure that negative values are correctly interpreted and displayed with a zero line guide.\n\n2. **src/js/components/DataChart/YAxis.js**: This file is responsible for rendering the Y-axis of the chart. It includes logic for determining the scale and labels of the Y-axis, which are crucial when dealing with negative values. The Y-axis needs to be able to accommodate negative values and display them correctly, which may require changes to how the axis bounds and labels are calculated and rendered.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a DataChart component that fails to render bars when the data includes negative values. The expected behavior is for the chart to display a zero line guide by default when negative values are present, and allow customization of attributes such as colors for negative values. However, the actual behavior observed is that the chart does not display anything when negative values are included in the data."
