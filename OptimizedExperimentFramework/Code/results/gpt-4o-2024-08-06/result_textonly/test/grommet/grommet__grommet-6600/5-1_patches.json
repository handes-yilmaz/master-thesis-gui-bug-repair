    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to add a `layer` prop to the `DataFilters` component to allow filters to be displayed in a separate layer, providing more space for the user. The current implementation only supports a `drop` prop, which results in filters overflowing in the dropdown menu when there are many filters.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\nThe bug is caused by the lack of a `layer` prop in the `DataFilters` component, which would allow the filters to be displayed in a separate layer instead of a dropdown. The current implementation only supports a dropdown (`drop` prop), which is not sufficient for a large number of filters.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nWe need to modify the `DataFilters` component to support a `layer` prop and update the prop types accordingly. This involves:\n1. Adding a `layer` prop to the `DataFilters` component.\n2. Updating the logic to render the filters in a separate layer when the `layer` prop is true.\n3. Updating the prop types to include the new `layer` prop.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const DataFilters = ({ drop, children, heading, ...rest }) => {\n=======\nexport const DataFilters = ({ drop, layer, children, heading, ...rest }) => {\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const controlled = useMemo(() => drop, [drop]);\n=======\n  const controlled = useMemo(() => drop || layer, [drop, layer]);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  if (!controlled) return content;\n=======\n  if (!controlled) return layer ? <Layer>{content}</Layer> : content;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/DataFilters/propTypes.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  };\n=======\n    layer: PropTypes.bool,\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes will add support for a `layer` prop, allowing the `DataFilters` component to display filters in a separate layer when needed, thus resolving the issue of filters overflowing in the dropdown menu."
