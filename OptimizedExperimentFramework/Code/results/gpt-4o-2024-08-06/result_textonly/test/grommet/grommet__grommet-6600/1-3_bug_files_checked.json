        "explanation": "The files related to the DataFilters component are likely involved because they define the functionality of filter display, including handling container properties like dropdowns and layers. Thus, 'DataFilters.js', along with its 'index.js' and 'propTypes.js', would require modification to implement and support the 'layer' prop functionality. Additionally, the 'Layer.js' file, which is responsible for managing layer components, might need to be updated to correctly interpret and render the new manner of displaying filters proposed in the solution. Supporting files such as 'index.js' and 'propTypes.js' within the Layer directory could also require adjustments to integrate and extend the new feature effectively.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the DataFilters component, which has a dropdown menu that overflows when many filters are selected. The expected behavior is to have an additional 'layer' prop that allows filters to be displayed in a separate, spacious layer instead of a dropdown, as depicted in the reference image. However, the actual behavior shows that the dropdown menu overflows, indicating a need for more space for filter display."

        "explanation": "The bug report specifically mentions an issue with the 'DataFilters' component. Within the repository structure, the components related to 'DataFilters' are located in the 'src/js/components/DataFilters/' directory. The main files of interest are 'DataFilters.js', which likely contains the component's implementation, and 'propTypes.js', which defines the properties and could include the necessary 'layer' prop. Modifying these files would be essential to introducing the new 'layer' prop and implementing the required functionality to prevent overflow by displaying filters on a separate layer.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the DataFilters component where the dropdown menu overflows when a large number of filters are present. The expected behavior is to have a 'layer' prop that allows the filters to be displayed on a separate, more spacious layer, rather than in a compact dropdown."
