        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js**: This file contains the implementation of the DataFilters component. The current implementation uses a 'drop' prop to control the dropdown menu. To fix the bug, this file needs to be modified to introduce a 'layer' prop that allows displaying filters in a separate layer, addressing the overflow issue.\n\n2. **src/js/components/DataFilters/propTypes.js**: This file defines the prop types for the DataFilters component. To support the new 'layer' prop, this file needs to be updated to include the 'layer' prop type, ensuring that the component correctly validates the new prop.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the DataFilters component, which currently has a 'drop' prop that enables dropdown menu selection. However, when there are many filters, the dropdown menu overflows, as shown in the second image. The expected behavior is to have a 'layer' prop that allows the user to display filters in a separate layer, providing more space, as depicted in the first image."
