If sorting logic is handled directly within this file, it might need adjustments to handle null or undefined properties properly.\n2. **src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js**: This file might specifically handle the sorting logic for the DataTable. If sorting is broken for certain properties, adjustments in this file would be crucial.\n3. **src/js/components/DataTable/__tests__/DataTable-test.js**: Test files related to DataTable would need to include test cases that cover scenarios with null or undefined values to ensure the issue is fixed and doesn't regress in future updates.\n4. **src/js/components/DataTable/utils.js**: If there are utility functions for managing or preparing data before sorting, this file might need updates to handle undefined or null values appropriately.",

        "explanation": "The files related to the bug are likely part of the DataTable component, as the bug specifically affects the sorting functionality within data tables when handling null or undefined values. The DataTable.js file is presumably the main component file where the core logic for rendering and interacting with DataTable is written, which is crucial for sorting behaviors. Additionally, the Sorter.js file likely contains the sorting functions or utilities specific to ordering table data, and modifications will be needed here to address how null and undefined values are considered during the sorting process.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to a sorting feature within a DataTable component where the expected behavior is to handle null or undefined values as empty strings during sorting operations. However, the actual behavior shows that when sorting a column, items are not reordered correctly if they have properties with null or undefined values. The provided image shows an example table where sorting has failed due to this issue."
