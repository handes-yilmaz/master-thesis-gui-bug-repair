        "explanation": "The `DataTable` class in `DataTable.js` is a key component because it is responsible for managing the data display, including sorting. The comments in the compressed file mention the handling of data that needs to be filtered and sorted, indicating that this file likely contains logic relevant to the bug.\n\nThe `Sorter` function in `Sorter.js` is directly involved in the sorting mechanism. It uses the `property` parameter to determine which column to sort by and adjusts the sort icon based on the current sorting direction. Since the issue pertains to sorting with undefined or null properties, the logic within this function is crucial to understanding and fixing the bug. The `Sorter` function likely needs modifications to handle cases where the `property` value is null or undefined, ensuring these are treated as empty strings for sorting purposes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a Data Table component where sorting functionality breaks when any of the properties in the table are null or undefined. The expected behavior is for undefined properties to be treated as empty strings during sorting. However, the current implementation does not reorder the items correctly if a property is set to null or undefined, as demonstrated in the provided Codesandbox link and image."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to how sorting is implemented and handled in the data table component. The 'DataTable.js' is likely involved as it is the main component responsible for rendering the data table and managing its state, including sorting. The 'Sorter.js' file is directly related because it handles the sorting button and logic, including determining the sort order and direction based on properties. The 'Sorter' function in 'Sorter.js' is critical because it directly interacts with the sorting mechanism, handling user interactions to initiate sorting and applying sort icons. Since the issue arises when properties are null or undefined, the logic within these components likely needs adjustment to handle such cases properly, treating undefined values as empty strings as expected.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a data table in which sorting by a column does not work as expected when certain properties within the data are null or undefined. Specifically, the expected behavior is for undefined properties to be treated as empty strings during sorting. However, the actual behavior observed is that items are not reordered properly if they have null or undefined values in the column being sorted."
