    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the animation behavior of the circle Meter component. The problem is that the animation is not smooth and behaves inconsistently across different browsers. The root cause of this issue is the use of a \"transition all\" property on the SVG path, which is causing the strange animation effect.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided GIF image shows a circle meter with a jerky animation when the value changes. This is due to the transition property applied to all attributes of the SVG path, which is not ideal for animating SVG paths smoothly.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `StyledMeter` component, where the transition is applied to the path elements. Specifically, the line `transition: all 0.3s;` in `StyledMeter.js` is causing the issue. This line applies a transition to all properties, which is not suitable for SVG path animations.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the transition property to only apply to the stroke-dashoffset property, which is commonly used for animating SVG paths smoothly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  path {\n    transition: all 0.3s;\n  }\n=======\n  path {\n    transition: stroke-dashoffset 0.3s;\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change will ensure that only the stroke-dashoffset property is animated, leading to a smoother transition effect when the value of the circle meter changes. This should resolve the issue across different browsers, providing a consistent and smooth animation experience."
