        "explanation": "The bug pertains to the styling of a Select component, which involves an <input> element where padding issues arise specifically in Safari. Therefore, the files related to the Select component are likely to be relevant.\\n1. `Select.js`: This is the main component file where the Select logic and JSX are set up. It is probable that the input element rendering is handled here, and adding or modifying CSS styles directly or through the Styled-Components could solve the issue.\\n2. `SelectContainer.js`: This file likely holds additional logic or style settings for the Select component, which might include handling the input's styling properties that need adjustment.\\n3. `select.stories.js`: It's included here as it might be beneficial to ensure the solution can be verified through the component's storybook example, providing a visual check to confirm the bug is fixed across browsers.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is with the Select component where the search input field appears very small, particularly when viewed in the Safari browser. The padding for the input is being ignored, leading to a smaller than expected appearance. This issue is visible in the provided Safari bug scenario image and the comparison image showing how it should appear in Chrome."

        ],
        "explanation": "The problem specifically revolves around the behavior and styling of a search input within a Select component. The likely candidates for modification are:\n\n1. **src/js/components/Select/Select.js**: This is the main file for the Select component, where the input field is likely to be implemented. Any changes to the properties of the input, such as the addition of '-webkit-appearance: textfield;', would be made here.\n\n2. **src/js/components/Select/select.stories.js**: This file contains stories for the Select component and may need adjustments to reflect and test changes in appearance, ensuring that the bug fix behaves as expected across different scenarios.\n\n3. **src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js**: If there is any container logic affecting the rendering or styles of the Select component, it would be here. Changes might be necessary to ensure the input field renders correctly in Safari, applying relevant styles.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where the visual representation of a select search input is smaller than expected on Safari, compared to the expected size which appears correctly on Chrome. This seems to be due to Safari's handling of the CSS property for search inputs. Adding the '-webkit-appearance: textfield;' style property to the search input seems to resolve the issue, based on previous solutions in version 1 of the project."
