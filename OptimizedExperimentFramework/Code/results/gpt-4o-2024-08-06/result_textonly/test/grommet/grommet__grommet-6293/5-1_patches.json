    "1/1": "To address the issue where the \"Meter\" component of type \"circle\" doesn't render all values, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The bug report indicates that the issue was introduced in version `v2.25.0`, and the expected behavior was present in `v2.24.0`.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report and images suggest that the \"circle\" type meter is only rendering the last data point instead of all data points. This indicates a potential issue in the rendering logic of the \"Circle\" component, specifically in how it iterates over and processes the `values` array.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nUpon reviewing the code snippets, the issue likely lies in the `Circle.js` file, particularly in the loop that processes each value in the `values` array. The logic for calculating the `endAngle` and updating the `startAngle` might be incorrect, causing only the last segment to be rendered.\n\n### Bug Location and Patch\nThe problem seems to be in the `forEach` loop within the `Circle` component where the `endAngle` is calculated and the `startAngle` is updated. The logic for determining the `endAngle` might not be correctly handling the accumulation of angles for each segment.\n\nLet's generate a patch to fix this issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      if (startValue + value >= max) {\n        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;\n      } else {\n        endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);\n      }\n=======\n      endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);\n      if (endAngle > (type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360)) {\n        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Patch\n- **Original Logic**: The original logic sets the `endAngle` to a fixed value (90 or 360) if the `startValue + value` exceeds `max`. This could cause the loop to incorrectly calculate angles for segments, leading to only the last segment being rendered.\n- **Updated Logic**: The patch ensures that `endAngle` is always calculated using `translateEndAngle`, and then checks if it exceeds the maximum angle (90 for semicircle, 360 for full circle). If it does, it caps the `endAngle` to the maximum. This ensures that each segment is rendered correctly without prematurely terminating the loop.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that all values are rendered correctly in the \"circle\" type meter."
