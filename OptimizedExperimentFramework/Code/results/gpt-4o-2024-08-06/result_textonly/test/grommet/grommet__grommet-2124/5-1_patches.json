    "1/1": "To address the issue of the Grommet2 Calendar not displaying properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), we need to identify the root cause and make necessary code adjustments. The problem is likely due to the use of modern JavaScript features or CSS that IE11 does not support. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to locate and fix the issue.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report indicates that the Calendar component is not rendering correctly in IE11. The screenshot shows a broken layout, which suggests that some CSS or JavaScript features used in the Calendar component are not compatible with IE11.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nIE11 has limited support for modern JavaScript and CSS features. The issues could be due to:\n1. CSS Flexbox properties not being fully supported.\n2. JavaScript methods or syntax that IE11 does not recognize (e.g., `Array.prototype.includes`, `Object.assign`, etc.).\n3. Use of `Date` methods or other JavaScript features that behave differently in IE11.\n\n### Bug Location and Fixes\nLet's examine the code snippets to identify potential issues and propose fixes.\n\n#### 1. CSS Flexbox Compatibility\nThe `StyledWeek` and `StyledDay` components use Flexbox properties. We need to ensure compatibility with IE11.\n\n#### 2. JavaScript Compatibility\nThe `Calendar.js` file may use JavaScript features not supported by IE11. We need to ensure that all JavaScript code is compatible with IE11.\n\n### Proposed Patches\n\n#### Patch 1: CSS Flexbox Compatibility\nEnsure that Flexbox properties are compatible with IE11 by adding necessary prefixes or adjustments.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const StyledWeek = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  flex-justify: between;\n`;\n=======\nexport const StyledWeek = styled.div`\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\n  display: flex;\n  -ms-flex-direction: row;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n#### Patch 2: JavaScript Compatibility\nEnsure that JavaScript code is compatible with IE11 by avoiding unsupported methods or syntax.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst buildState = (props) => {\n  const { date, dates, firstDayOfWeek } = props;\n  let reference;\n  if (date) {\n    reference = new Date(date);\n  } else if (dates && dates.length > 0) {\n    if (typeof dates[0] === 'string') {\n      reference = new Date(dates[0]);\n    } else if (Array.isArray(dates[0])) {\n      reference = new Date(dates[0][0]);\n    } else {\n      reference = new Date();\n    }\n  } else {\n    reference = new Date();\n  }\n  return {\n    ...buildStartEnd(reference, firstDayOfWeek),\n    reference,\n    active: new Date(reference),\n  };\n};\n=======\nconst buildState = (props) => {\n  const { date, dates, firstDayOfWeek } = props;\n  let reference;\n  if (date) {\n    reference = new Date(date);\n  } else if (dates && dates.length > 0) {\n    if (typeof dates[0] === 'string') {\n      reference = new Date(dates[0]);\n    } else if (Array.isArray(dates[0])) {\n      reference = new Date(dates[0][0]);\n    } else {\n      reference = new Date();\n    }\n  } else {\n    reference = new Date();\n  }\n  return Object.assign({}, buildStartEnd(reference, firstDayOfWeek), {\n    reference: reference,\n    active: new Date(reference),\n  });\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese patches aim to address the compatibility issues with IE11 by ensuring that both CSS and JavaScript are compatible with the browser's capabilities. After applying these changes, the Calendar component should render correctly in IE11."
