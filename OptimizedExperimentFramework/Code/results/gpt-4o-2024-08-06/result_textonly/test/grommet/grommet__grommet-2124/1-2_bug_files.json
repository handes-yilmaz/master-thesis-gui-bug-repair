        "explanation": "The identified files are directly related to the Calendar component which is reported to be malfunctioning.\\n\\n1. `src/js/components/Calendar/Calendar.js`: This is the main file for the Calendar component, likely containing its core logic, rendering flow, and possibly code not compatible with IE11.\\n\\n2. `src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js`: This file probably handles the styling aspects of the Calendar component, which may include CSS properties or methods not supported by IE11.\\n\\n3. `src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js`: This utility file likely contains helper functions or compatibility-related functionality for the Calendar, which might require adjustments for IE11.\\n\\n4. `src/js/components/Calendar/__tests__/Calendar-test.js`: This test file is crucial to verify that any planned fixes for compatibility are working as expected. It should include tests replicating the IE11 environment to confirm that the changes resolve the issue.\\n\\nThese files collectively contribute to the bug as they encapsulate the rendering, styling, and logic of the Calendar component, where the IE11 specific issues likely reside.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is that the Grommet2 Calendar component does not display properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), as evidenced by the provided screenshot. The image shows an improperly rendered calendar interface that fails to match the expected appearance in IE11, suggesting a compatibility issue."

        "explanation": "The issue pertains to the Calendar component not displaying correctly in IE11, which is likely due to compatibility issues or missing polyfills required by IE11 since it does not support many modern JavaScript features out of the box.\\n\\n- `Calendar.js` is the main file that defines how the Calendar component is structured and behaves. Any compatibility issues would first need to be addressed here.\\n\\n- `StyledCalendar.js` might be responsible for styling issues that don't render as expected due to lack of support for certain CSS features in IE11.\\n\\n- `utils.js` could contain utility functions for the Calendar component, which might be written in a way not supported by IE11, necessitating a review for compatibility.\\n\\nThese files collectively encompass the core functionality, styling, and utility operations of the Calendar component, making them critical areas to review for any adjustments needed to address IE11-specific issues.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Grommet2 Calendar component does not render properly when viewed in Internet Explorer 11, making it unusable for users on this browser."
