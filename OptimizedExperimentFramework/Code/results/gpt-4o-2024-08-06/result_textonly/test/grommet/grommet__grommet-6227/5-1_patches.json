    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that when a required field is dynamically removed from the form, the form's validation state is updated accordingly. The problem arises because the form remains invalid even after a required field is removed, which should not be the case if all other validations are satisfied.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\nThe bug report describes a scenario where a form becomes invalid when dynamically adding and removing required fields. The expected behavior is that when a required field is removed, the form should be valid if all other fields are valid. However, the form remains invalid due to the validation logic not updating correctly when fields are removed.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to the way the form's validation state is managed. Specifically, the validation logic does not account for the removal of fields, leading to stale validation results that incorrectly mark the form as invalid.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe issue is likely located in the `Form.js` file, particularly in the logic that handles validation and the removal of fields. We need to ensure that when a field is removed, its validation state is also removed, and the form's validity is recalculated.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Form/Form.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst filterRemovedFields = (prevValidations) => {\n  const nextValidations = prevValidations;\n  return Object.keys(nextValidations)\n    .filter(\n      (n) =>\n        !validationRulesRef.current[n] || nextValidations[n] === undefined,\n    )\n    .forEach((n) => delete nextValidations[n]);\n};\n=======\nconst filterRemovedFields = (prevValidations) => {\n  const nextValidations = { ...prevValidations };\n  Object.keys(nextValidations)\n    .filter((n) => !validationRulesRef.current[n])\n    .forEach((n) => delete nextValidations[n]);\n  return nextValidations;\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Form/Form.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nsetValidationResults((prevValidationResults) => {\n  // Keep any previous errors and infos for untouched keys,\n  // these may have come from a Submit.\n  const nextErrors = {\n    ...prevValidationResults.errors,\n    ...validatedErrors,\n  };\n  const nextInfos = {\n    ...prevValidationResults.infos,\n    ...validatedInfos,\n  };\n  // Remove previous errors and infos for keys no longer in the\n  // form, these may have been fields removed from a dynamic form.\n  filterRemovedFields(nextErrors);\n  filterRemovedFields(nextInfos);\n  const nextValidationResults = {\n    errors: nextErrors,\n    infos: nextInfos,\n  };\n  if (onValidate)\n    onValidate({\n      ...nextValidationResults,\n      valid: buildValid(nextErrors),\n    });\n  validationResultsRef.current = nextValidationResults;\n  return nextValidationResults;\n});\n=======\nsetValidationResults((prevValidationResults) => {\n  // Keep any previous errors and infos for untouched keys,\n  // these may have come from a Submit.\n  const nextErrors = filterRemovedFields({\n    ...prevValidationResults.errors,\n    ...validatedErrors,\n  });\n  const nextInfos = filterRemovedFields({\n    ...prevValidationResults.infos,\n    ...validatedInfos,\n  });\n  const nextValidationResults = {\n    errors: nextErrors,\n    infos: nextInfos,\n  };\n  if (onValidate)\n    onValidate({\n      ...nextValidationResults,\n      valid: buildValid(nextErrors),\n    });\n  validationResultsRef.current = nextValidationResults;\n  return nextValidationResults;\n});\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **filterRemovedFields Function**: The function now returns a new object with the removed fields filtered out, ensuring that the validation state is correctly updated when fields are removed.\n\n2. **setValidationResults Logic**: The logic now uses the updated `filterRemovedFields` function to ensure that the validation results do not include fields that have been removed from the form. This ensures that the form's validity is recalculated correctly when fields are dynamically removed."
