    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to analyze the provided code snippets and identify the root cause of the problem. The error message \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')\" suggests that there is an attempt to access a property on an undefined value, likely related to the `gap` property when it is specified in pixels.\n\n### Bug Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe issue arises when the `gap` property is specified in pixels (e.g., `gap=\"10px\"`) and the `border` property is set to `\"between\"`. The code attempts to process the `gap` value, but it seems to expect a specific format or type that is not being met when the value is in pixels. This leads to the `TypeError` when the code tries to perform operations on the `gap` value.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe problem likely occurs in the `StyledBoxGap` component within the `StyledBox.js` file, where the `gapStyle` function is used to calculate styles based on the `gap` and `border` properties. The function may not handle pixel values correctly, leading to the error.\n\n### Proposed Patch\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `gapStyle` function can handle pixel values correctly. We will modify the `gapStyle` function to parse pixel values and calculate the necessary offsets for the border.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst gapStyle = (directionProp, gap, responsive, border, theme) => {\n  const metric = theme.global.edgeSize[gap] || gap;\n  const breakpoint = getBreakpointStyle(theme, theme.box.responsiveBreakpoint);\n  const responsiveMetric = responsive && breakpoint && breakpoint.edgeSize[gap];\n=======\nconst gapStyle = (directionProp, gap, responsive, border, theme) => {\n  const metric = theme.global.edgeSize[gap] || (gap.match(/px$/) ? gap : theme.global.edgeSize[gap]);\n  const breakpoint = getBreakpointStyle(theme, theme.box.responsiveBreakpoint);\n  const responsiveMetric = responsive && breakpoint && (breakpoint.edgeSize[gap] || (gap.match(/px$/) ? gap : breakpoint.edgeSize[gap]));\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Parsing Pixel Values**: The patch modifies the `gapStyle` function to check if the `gap` value ends with \"px\" using `gap.match(/px$/)`. If it does, it uses the pixel value directly instead of looking it up in `theme.global.edgeSize`.\n- **Responsive Handling**: Similarly, for responsive metrics, it checks if the `gap` value is in pixels and uses it directly if so.\n\nThis patch ensures that the `gap` value is correctly interpreted and processed when specified in pixels, preventing the `TypeError` and allowing the `Box` component to render correctly with a `border=\"between\"` and a pixel `gap`."
