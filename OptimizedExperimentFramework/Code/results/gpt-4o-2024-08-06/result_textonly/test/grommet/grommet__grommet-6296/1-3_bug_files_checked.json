        "explanation": "The bug is directly related to the PageHeader component since it is responsible for rendering the heading that is not wrapping correctly. The primary file, 'PageHeader.js', likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle text wrapping. 'StyledPageHeader.js' is included because styling issues are often resolved in related styled components, and adjustments here could fix the overflow problem (e.g., by setting CSS properties like 'word-wrap' or 'overflow'). Additionally, 'PageHeader-test.tsx' is a test file related to the PageHeader component, which may need updates to include new test cases to ensure the issue is resolved and remains fixed in the future.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a long string passed as a heading to the PageHeader component, which overflows and collides with other content instead of wrapping when it runs out of space. This issue arises because the PageHeader component does not handle long strings appropriately, failing to make the text wrap as intended."

            "src/js/components/PageHeader/stories/Simple.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue lies with the 'PageHeader' component as described in the bug report. The files likely to be related to resolving the bug include 'PageHeader.js', which implements the component where the overflow logic would be managed, and 'propTypes.js' to ensure that proper data types are handled correctly for the heading. Additionally, tests and stories such as 'PageHeader-test.tsx' and 'Simple.js' may need to be updated or reviewed to include test cases for long strings and ensure they are wrapped correctly according to the expected UI behavior. These files together form the core of implementation and visual verification for the 'PageHeader' component functionality.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is that when a long string is passed as a heading to 'PageHeader', it doesn't wrap properly and overflows instead, leading to visual overlap with adjacent elements. The expected behavior is that long strings should wrap when they reach the boundary of their parent container, maintaining a clean and readable UI layout."
