    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `PageHeader` component's heading wraps when it encounters a long string, rather than overflowing. The problem is likely due to the CSS styling of the `Heading` component within the `PageHeader` component. We need to modify the styling to allow text wrapping.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\nThe provided image shows a `PageHeader` component where the heading text is overflowing its container, colliding with other content. This indicates that the CSS styling does not allow for text wrapping, which is necessary for handling long strings.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\nIn the `PageHeader.js` file, the `Heading` component is used to render the title. We need to ensure that the `Heading` component has the appropriate CSS properties to allow text wrapping.\n\n### Patch Generation\nWe will modify the `Heading` component's styling to include CSS properties that enable text wrapping. Specifically, we will add `word-wrap: break-word;` and `overflow-wrap: break-word;` to ensure that long words are broken and wrapped correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<Box gridArea=\"title\">\n  {typeof title === 'string' ? (\n    <Heading {...sizeStyle(size, 'title', theme)}>{title}</Heading>\n  ) : (\n    title\n  )}\n</Box>\n=======\n<Box gridArea=\"title\">\n  {typeof title === 'string' ? (\n    <Heading\n      {...sizeStyle(size, 'title', theme)}\n      style={{ wordWrap: 'break-word', overflowWrap: 'break-word' }}\n    >\n      {title}\n    </Heading>\n  ) : (\n    title\n  )}\n</Box>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the `Heading` component within the `PageHeader` will wrap long strings, preventing overflow and collision with other content."
