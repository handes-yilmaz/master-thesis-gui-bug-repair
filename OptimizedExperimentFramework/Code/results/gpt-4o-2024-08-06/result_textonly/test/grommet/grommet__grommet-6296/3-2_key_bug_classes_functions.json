        "explanation": "The 'PageHeader' class in 'src/js/components/PageHeader/PageHeader.js' is directly responsible for rendering the page header, including the title. The overflow issue is likely related to how the 'Heading' component inside 'PageHeader' is styled or used. The component's styling needs to ensure that long strings wrap appropriately, preventing overflow and collision with other content. This makes the 'PageHeader' class a key element in addressing the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the 'PageHeader' component where the heading with a long string overflows rather than wrapping when it runs out of space. This is causing the heading to collide with other content, as depicted in the provided screenshot."

        "explanation": "The issue arises with the PageHeader component, specifically with how it handles the 'title' prop when it is a long string. In the PageHeader component, the title is rendered within a 'Heading' element. If the title is a long string, it should be styled to wrap within its container. The current implementation does not account for this wrapping, leading to overflow. The 'PageHeader' class and function are therefore the primary areas where changes need to be made to address the overflow issue. Adjustments to CSS or additional logic to ensure text wrapping would likely be needed in the 'PageHeader' class/function.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the PageHeader component where a long string used as a heading overflows the designated space and collides with other content instead of wrapping."
