        "explanation": "The misalignment issue is likely due to how the NameValueList and NameValuePair components handle alignment properties. The NameValueList.js file is responsible for setting up the grid layout and alignment properties for the list, which includes the name and value pairs. The NameValuePair.js file handles the rendering of individual name-value pairs and their alignment. Both files are crucial because they define how the alignment properties are applied and rendered, which directly affects the vertical alignment of the name and value elements.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a misalignment issue in the NameValuePair component where the name and value are not vertically aligned as expected. The user wants both the name and value to be horizontally centered, but currently, they are not aligned properly, as shown in the provided image."
