    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the creation and referencing of `bpmn:CategoryValue` inside a collapsed sub-process is handled correctly. The error message indicates an unresolved reference, which suggests that the `CategoryValue` is not being properly linked or created.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe images and bug report indicate that when a group is created inside a collapsed sub-process, the BPMN export fails due to an unresolved reference. This is likely because the `CategoryValue` is not being correctly associated with the process definitions or is not being created properly.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue likely resides in the `GroupBehavior.js` and `CategoryUtil.js` files, where the creation and management of `CategoryValue` are handled. We need to ensure that the `CategoryValue` is correctly created and linked to the process definitions.\n\n### Patches\n\n#### 1. `lib/features/modeling/behavior/GroupBehavior.js`\n\nEnsure that the `CategoryValue` is correctly linked to the process definitions when a group is created.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/GroupBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      var definitions = getDefinitions(),\n          categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);\n\n      // link the reference to the Group\n      businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;\n=======\n      var definitions = getDefinitions(),\n          categoryValue = createCategoryValue(definitions, bpmnFactory);\n\n      // Ensure categoryValue is linked to the correct parent\n      if (categoryValue) {\n        businessObject.categoryValueRef = categoryValue;\n        categoryValue.$parent = definitions;\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n#### 2. `lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/CategoryUtil.js`\n\nEnsure that the `CategoryValue` is correctly added to the definitions.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/util/CategoryUtil.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  collectionAdd(definitions.get('rootElements'), category);\n  getBusinessObject(category).$parent = definitions;\n  getBusinessObject(categoryValue).$parent = category;\n=======\n  if (definitions && category) {\n    collectionAdd(definitions.get('rootElements'), category);\n    getBusinessObject(category).$parent = definitions;\n    getBusinessObject(categoryValue).$parent = category;\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes ensure that the `CategoryValue` is properly created and linked to the process definitions, preventing unresolved references during BPMN export."
