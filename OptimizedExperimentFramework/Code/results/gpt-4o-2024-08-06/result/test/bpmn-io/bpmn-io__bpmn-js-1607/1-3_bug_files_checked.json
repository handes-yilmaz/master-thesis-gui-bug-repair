        "bug_scenario": "The user encounters a warning about an unresolved reference when re-importing a BPMN diagram after adding a group to a collapsed sub-process. This suggests an issue in handling or referencing the group created inside sub-processes."

        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when trying to import a BPMN diagram that contains a group inside a collapsed sub-process, leading to an import warning: 'unresolved reference <CategoryValue_01k5toe>'. This issue suggests a potential mishandling of references for categorized elements during export or import of the BPMN data."
