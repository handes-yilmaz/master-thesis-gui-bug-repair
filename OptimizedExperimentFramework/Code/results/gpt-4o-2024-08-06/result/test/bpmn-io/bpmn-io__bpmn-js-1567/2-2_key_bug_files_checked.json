        "explanation": "1. **DrilldownBreadcrumbs.js**: This file manages the breadcrumbs for navigation. The error occurs when trying to set the root element, indicating a potential issue with how root changes are handled.\n\n2. **DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js**: This file handles the overlay behavior for drilldowns. It includes logic for updating overlays when shapes are toggled or moved, which is relevant to the root change issue.\n\n3. **DrilldownUtil.js**: This utility file provides functions related to plane IDs, which are crucial for managing root elements and their overlays.\n\n4. **UpdateCanvasRootHandler.js**: This file manages the execution and reversion of root element updates on the canvas, directly related to the error when changing root elements.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when trying to navigate back to the parent process after wrapping a collapsed sub-process with a pool and moving into it. An error is thrown indicating that the drilldown overlay is not aware of root changes."
