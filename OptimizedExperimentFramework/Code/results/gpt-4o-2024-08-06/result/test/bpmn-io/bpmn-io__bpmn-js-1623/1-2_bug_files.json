        "explanation": "The files under the 'drilldown' feature are relevant because they are responsible for managing drilldown behaviors and overlays, which are directly related to handling subprocess navigation and deep linking. The bug specifically mentions issues with linking overlays in subprocess navigation, which would likely be controlled by these components.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the loss of deep linking overlay when navigating subprocesses using a multi-diagram plugin on Camunda Modeler 5.0. As the animation shows, the deep linking overlay for subprocesses gets lost during navigation."

            "lib/import/BpmnTreeWalker.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js and SubprocessCompatibility.js files are related to the drilldown functionality and compatibility of subprocesses, which are directly involved in handling overlays and navigation between diagrams. DrilldownUtil.js provides utility functions that could be used in rendering overlays or managing drilldown links, given the context of deep linking and subprocess navigation. The BpmnTreeWalker.js might be involved in managing or updating the BPMN elements and their visual representation, which is crucial in ensuring overlays are preserved.",
        "bug_scenario": "The animation in the bug report demonstrates an issue where the deep linking overlay for a subprocess in a BPMN model is not retained. This issue arises when using a multi-diagram plugin that facilitates navigation between processes and subprocesses. The feature seems to be malfunctioning after integrating with the newer deep linking functionality introduced in the latest versions of bpmn-js and Camunda Modeler. The image shows the modeling interface lacking the expected overlay on a subprocess."
