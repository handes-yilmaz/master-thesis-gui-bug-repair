        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/drilldown/DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js**: This file manages the overlay behavior for drilldown functionality. The issue with overlays disappearing is likely related to how overlays are added or removed in this file.\n\n2. **lib/features/drilldown/SubprocessCompatibility.js**: This file handles compatibility for subprocesses, including creating new planes for collapsed subprocesses. The problem might be related to how subprocesses are managed and displayed.\n\n3. **lib/util/DrilldownUtil.js**: This utility file provides functions for handling plane IDs and shapes, which are crucial for maintaining the correct overlay and navigation behavior. Any issues with ID management could lead to overlays not appearing correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the loss of deep linking overlays for subprocesses in a multi-diagram plugin for BPMN. The user wants to integrate deep linking with their existing multi-diagram navigation functionality, but the overlay disappears unexpectedly."
