    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the docking of the new incoming sequence flow is correctly positioned. The problem seems to be related to the way the intersection and docking points are calculated when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image shows a sequence flow layout breaking when an element is dropped onto it. The docking point of the new incoming sequence flow is incorrectly set to the top left corner, which suggests that the intersection calculation or the docking logic is flawed.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue likely resides in the `insertShape` function within the `DropOnFlowBehavior.js` file. The docking point calculation needs to be adjusted to ensure it correctly reflects the intended position on the sequence flow.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : position;\n\n      // if last waypointBefore is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {\n        waypointsBefore.push(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n=======\n      dockingPoint = intersection.bendpoint ? waypoints[intersection.index] : getMid(position);\n\n      // if last waypointBefore is inside shape's bounds, ignore docking point\n      if (!isPointInsideBBox(shape, waypointsBefore[waypointsBefore.length-1])) {\n        waypointsBefore.push(copy(dockingPoint));\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Change in Docking Point Calculation**: The docking point is now calculated using `getMid(position)` instead of directly using `position`. This ensures that the docking point is centered correctly on the sequence flow, preventing the layout from breaking.\n- **Context**: The change is made within the `insertShape` function, where the docking point is determined based on the intersection. This adjustment should fix the issue of the sequence flow layout breaking when an element is dropped onto it."
