        "explanation": "The file 'DropOnFlowBehavior.js' contains the logic for handling elements being dropped onto a flow. The function 'insertShape' is responsible for reconnecting the start/end of a connection after an element is dropped. The issue likely lies in how the docking point is calculated and applied, causing the layout to break when the element is dropped.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when an element is dropped onto a sequence flow, causing the layout to break. The new incoming sequence flow docks at the top left corner, disrupting the intended layout."
