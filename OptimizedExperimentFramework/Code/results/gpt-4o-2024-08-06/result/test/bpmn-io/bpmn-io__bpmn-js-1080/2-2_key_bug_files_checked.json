        "explanation": "1. **DeleteLaneBehavior.js**: This file handles the behavior when a lane is deleted. The issue might be related to how the system compensates for lane deletion, affecting the ability to connect message flows correctly.\n\n2. **LaneUtil.js**: This utility file manages lane-related operations, such as collecting lanes and getting child lanes. The problem could stem from incorrect handling of lanes after deletion, affecting message flow connections.\n\n3. **AddLaneHandler.js**: This file deals with adding lanes. The bug might be related to how lanes are added and removed, impacting the connection logic for message flows.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when trying to connect a message flow to the boundary of a pool that previously had more than one lane. The connection is only possible by dropping the connector at the header of the pool, not inside the single lane of the pool."
