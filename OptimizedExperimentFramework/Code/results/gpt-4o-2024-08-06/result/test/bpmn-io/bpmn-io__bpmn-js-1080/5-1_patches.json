    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that message flows can be connected to the boundary of a pool even after lanes have been added and removed. The problem seems to be related to how the pool's boundaries are managed after lane modifications.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe bug scenario shows that after adding and removing lanes, the pool's boundary does not allow message flows to connect properly. This suggests that the pool's boundary is not being recalculated or updated correctly after lane modifications.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause likely lies in the handling of lane deletions and the subsequent adjustment of pool boundaries. The `DeleteLaneBehavior.js` file is responsible for managing lane deletions, and it seems that the pool's boundary is not being updated to reflect the removal of lanes.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nWe need to ensure that when lanes are deleted, the pool's boundary is recalculated to allow message flows to connect properly. This involves updating the `DeleteLaneBehavior.js` to adjust the pool's boundary after lane deletions.\n\n### Patches\n\nHere are the patches to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DeleteLaneBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (!siblings.length) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var offset;\n\n    if (bottomAffected.length && topAffected.length) {\n      offset = shape.height / 2;\n    } else {\n      offset = shape.height;\n    }\n=======\n    if (!siblings.length) {\n      // Update pool boundary when no siblings are present\n      modeling.updateBounds(oldParent, {\n        x: oldParent.x,\n        y: oldParent.y,\n        width: oldParent.width,\n        height: oldParent.height - shape.height\n      });\n      return;\n    }\n\n    var offset;\n\n    if (bottomAffected.length && topAffected.length) {\n      offset = shape.height / 2;\n    } else {\n      offset = shape.height;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that when a lane is deleted and no siblings are present, the pool's boundary is updated to reflect the removal of the lane. This should allow message flows to connect to the pool's boundary as expected."
