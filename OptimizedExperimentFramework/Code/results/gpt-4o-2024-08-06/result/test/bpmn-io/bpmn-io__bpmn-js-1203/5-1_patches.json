    "1/1": "To address the issue where Intermediate Events lose their properties when copied and pasted as Boundary Events, we need to ensure that all relevant properties are copied over during the paste operation. The bug is likely due to missing properties in the `copyProperties` function when pasting as a Boundary Event.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe provided image shows a user interface where an Intermediate Event is being copied and pasted. The bug report indicates that properties such as Async Continuations and Job Configurations are lost during this process.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause is likely in the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file, specifically in the `copyProperties` function. The properties related to Async Continuations and Job Configurations are not being copied over when the event is pasted as a Boundary Event.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nWe need to modify the `copyProperties` function to include these properties when pasting. Let's add the necessary properties to ensure they are copied correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [\n      'isExpanded',\n      'name'\n    ]);\n=======\n    copyProperties(descriptor, newBusinessObject, [\n      'isExpanded',\n      'name',\n      'asyncBefore',\n      'asyncAfter',\n      'jobPriority'\n    ]);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`asyncBefore`, `asyncAfter`, `jobPriority`**: These properties are related to Async Continuations and Job Configurations. By adding them to the `copyProperties` function, we ensure they are copied from the Intermediate Event to the Boundary Event during the paste operation."
