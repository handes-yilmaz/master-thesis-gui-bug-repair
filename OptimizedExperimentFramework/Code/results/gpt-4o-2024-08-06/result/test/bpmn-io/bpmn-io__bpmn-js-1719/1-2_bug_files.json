        "bug_scenario": "When a sub process is collapsed, the label of the start event within it becomes visible and even moves further outside the sub process boundary. This issue happens when clicking through the steps, although importing and exporting the diagram works fine."

        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves labels becoming visible after collapsing a sub-process that contains a start, task, and end event. The label of the start event moves outside unexpectedly. This occurs specifically when interaction steps are followed as described in the provided animation."
