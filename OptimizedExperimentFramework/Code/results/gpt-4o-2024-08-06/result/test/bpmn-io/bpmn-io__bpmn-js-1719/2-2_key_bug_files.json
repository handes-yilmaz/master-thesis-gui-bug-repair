        "explanation": "1. **LabelBehavior.js**: This file manages the behavior of labels, including their creation and positioning. The bug involves labels becoming visible and misaligned when a sub process is collapsed, indicating a potential issue in how labels are handled during this transition.\n\n2. **SubProcessPlaneBehavior.js**: This file deals with the creation and management of planes for subprocesses. Since the bug involves collapsing a subprocess, this file likely contains logic that affects how elements within a subprocess are displayed or hidden.\n\n3. **DrilldownOverlayBehavior.js**: This file manages overlays for drilldown functionality, which is relevant when subprocesses are collapsed or expanded. The bug involves the visibility of elements when a subprocess is collapsed, suggesting that the overlay behavior might be incorrectly handling visibility states.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when a sub process is collapsed, causing labels of start, task, and end events inside to become visible and misaligned. This issue is only triggered by specific user interactions, as shown in the provided GIF, where the label of the start event moves outside unexpectedly."
