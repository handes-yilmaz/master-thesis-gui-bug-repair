        "explanation": "1. `ReplaceOptions.js` - This file likely defines the options available for replacing elements, such as switching between DataObjectReference and DataStoreReference.\n2. `ReplaceMenuProvider.js` - This file may handle the logic and UI for the replacement menu, affecting how the menu items are presented to the user.\n3. `TypeUtil.js` (in `popup-menu/util`) - This utility file may be used to manage the types of elements that can be replaced, which is relevant to adding new replaceable options.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the DataObjectReference replace menu, which currently only contains the collection marker and feels incomplete. The suggestion is to allow switching between a DataObjectReference and a DataStoreReference to ensure that the replace menu is always populated with content."

        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/replace/ReplaceOptions.js**: This file likely contains the configuration or logic for defining replace options. Modifying this file would allow you to add 'DataStoreReference' and 'DataObjectReference' as valid switchable options.\n\n2. **lib/features/replace/ReplaceMenuProvider.js**: This file probably handles the rendering and interaction logic of the replace menu. Changes here would ensure that the new replace options are correctly integrated into the menu interface.\n\n3. **lib/features/popup-menu/util/TypeUtil.js**: Utility functions related to types or categories of elements, likely determining what elements can be replaced. Updating this file may be necessary to support new replace options for data objects.",
        "bug_scenario": "The feature request is about enhancing the 'replace menu' options for a 'DataObjectReference' by allowing it to switch to a 'DataStoreReference' and vice-versa. The current menu feels empty and unpopulated, as shown in the image. The proposal is to include alternatives in the menu to make it more intuitive and functional."
