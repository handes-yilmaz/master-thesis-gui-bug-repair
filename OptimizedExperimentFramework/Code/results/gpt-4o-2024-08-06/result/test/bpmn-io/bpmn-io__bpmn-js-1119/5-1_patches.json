    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue where replacing a message flow with a sequence flow does not correctly update the parent of the new connection. This results in the modeler crashing or the sequence flow not being part of the correct participant. The images illustrate a sequence flow being incorrectly placed or causing a crash when the connection source is a participant.\n\nThe root cause is likely that the new connection is not being assigned to the correct parent element in the BPMN model, leading to inconsistencies and errors in the diagram rendering.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippets are in `ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js`, where connections are replaced, and `UpdateSemanticParentHandler.js`, where semantic parents are updated. The issue likely lies in the handling of the parent assignment when a connection is replaced.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the new connection is assigned to the correct parent. This involves updating the parent assignment logic in the `ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js`.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/ReplaceConnectionBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    // replace SequenceFlow <> MessageFlow\n\n    if (replacementType) {\n      modeling.connect(source, target, {\n        type: replacementType,\n        waypoints: connection.waypoints.slice()\n      });\n    }\n  }\n=======\n    // replace SequenceFlow <> MessageFlow\n\n    if (replacementType) {\n      var newConnection = modeling.connect(source, target, {\n        type: replacementType,\n        waypoints: connection.waypoints.slice()\n      });\n\n      // Ensure the new connection is part of the correct parent\n      if (newConnection && parent !== newConnection.parent) {\n        modeling.updateSemanticParent(newConnection, parent);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that when a connection is replaced, the new connection is assigned to the correct parent, preventing the modeler from crashing and ensuring the sequence flow is part of the correct participant."
