        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js**: This file likely contains the logic responsible for handling the copy and paste operations within the BPMN framework. Since the bug involves labels not being retained when copying and pasting, this file may need a review to ensure labels are included in these operations.\n\n2. **lib/features/label-editing/LabelUtil.js**: Utility functions related to label manipulation are expected to be found here. Any quirks in handling labels during paste operations might stem from incorrect procedures or missing steps in these utilities.\n\n3. **lib/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js**: This file probably defines behaviors around labels, including how they should be treated during various modeling operations. Since label loss is observed as a behavioral issue, examining how labels are managed during diagram manipulations here is essential.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs during copy/paste operations involving BPMN diagram elements. Specifically, labels associated with elements (e.g., tasks or events) get lost when participant contents are copied, cleared from the canvas, and then pasted back. The provided image example shows a simple BPMN diagram with two labeled tasks, 'A' and 'B'. Upon copying and pasting them as described, the labels do not appear, leaving the diagram without the textual annotations."

        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where labels are lost during the copy-paste of diagram elements within a BPMN diagram. Specifically, after copying a participant's contents and pasting them into a process diagram, the labels do not appear as expected. The image shows a simple BPMN diagram with labeled elements that might lose labels after a paste operation."
