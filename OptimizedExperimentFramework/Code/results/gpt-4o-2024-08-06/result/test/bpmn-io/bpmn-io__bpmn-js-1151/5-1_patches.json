    "1/1": "To address the issue of labels getting lost during pool extraction, we need to ensure that labels are correctly copied and pasted along with their associated elements. Here's a breakdown of the steps to identify and fix the bug:\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n**Image Description:**\nThe image shows a BPMN diagram with two elements labeled A and B. The issue arises when copying these elements; the labels are not retained when pasted into a new diagram.\n\n**Bug Root Cause:**\nThe problem likely stems from the handling of labels during the copy-paste process. The labels are not being copied or associated correctly with their elements, leading to their loss when pasted.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\n1. **`lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js`:**\n   - This file handles the copy-paste logic for BPMN elements.\n   - The function `copyProperties` is used to copy properties from the source to the target, but it does not include label handling.\n   - The `pasteElement` function does not account for labels when pasting elements.\n\n2. **`lib/features/label-editing/LabelUtil.js`:**\n   - This file provides utility functions for getting and setting labels.\n   - The `getLabel` and `setLabel` functions are crucial for handling label text.\n\n3. **`lib/features/modeling/behavior/LabelBehavior.js`:**\n   - This file manages label behavior during modeling operations.\n   - It ensures labels are created and updated correctly but does not directly handle copy-paste operations.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that labels are copied and pasted along with their elements. This involves modifying the `BpmnCopyPaste.js` file to handle labels during the copy-paste process.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      return descriptor;\n    }\n\n    // default sequence flow\n    if (businessObject.default) {\n      descriptor.default = businessObject.default.id;\n    }\n=======\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[descriptor.labelTarget]);\n      return descriptor;\n    }\n\n    // copy label text\n    var label = getLabel(element);\n    if (label) {\n      descriptor.label = label;\n    }\n\n    // default sequence flow\n    if (businessObject.default) {\n      descriptor.default = businessObject.default.id;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/copy-paste/BpmnCopyPaste.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    // do NOT copy business object if external label\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[ descriptor.labelTarget ]);\n\n      return;\n    }\n\n    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);\n=======\n    // handle label during paste\n    if (isLabel(descriptor)) {\n      descriptor.businessObject = getBusinessObject(cache[descriptor.labelTarget]);\n      setLabel(descriptor, descriptor.label || '', true);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    newBusinessObject = bpmnFactory.create(oldBusinessObject.$type);\n    if (descriptor.label) {\n      setLabel(newBusinessObject, descriptor.label);\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Copy Phase:** We ensure that the label text is copied along with the element by adding it to the descriptor.\n- **Paste Phase:** We handle the label during the paste operation by setting the label text on the new business object.\n\nThese changes should ensure that labels are retained during the copy-paste process, addressing the bug described in the report."
