        "explanation": "1. **lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js**: This file manages direct editing of labels. The bug is likely related to how direct editing is completed or canceled when an element is deleted.\n\n2. **lib/features/modeling/Modeling.js**: This file contains the `updateLabel` function, which is directly involved in the command that triggers the error. The issue may be related to how commands are executed or reverted.\n\n3. **lib/features/label-editing/cmd/UpdateLabelHandler.js**: This file handles the update of labels and includes logic for executing and reverting label changes. The error might be due to improper handling of label updates during element deletion.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when an element is deleted while direct editing is active, causing an 'illegal invocation' exception. The image shows a BPMN diagram with a context pad open, indicating an element is selected for editing or deletion."
