    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that direct editing is properly canceled when an element is removed. The error occurs because the direct editing session is still active when the element is deleted, leading to an illegal invocation.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image shows a flowchart with a decision point labeled \"desired dish?\" and a rectangle that seems to be in an editing state. The bug report indicates that deleting an element while direct editing is active triggers an exception.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause is that the direct editing session is not being canceled when an element is removed, which leads to an illegal invocation error when trying to update a label on a non-existent element.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe relevant code is in `LabelEditingProvider.js`, where direct editing should be canceled when an element is removed. The current implementation checks if direct editing is active but does not properly handle the cancellation in all scenarios.\n\n### Patches\n\nHere are the patches to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/label-editing/LabelEditingProvider.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  eventBus.on([\n    'shape.remove',\n    'connection.remove'\n  ], function(event) {\n\n    if (directEditing.isActive(event.element)) {\n      directEditing.cancel();\n    }\n  });\n=======\n  eventBus.on([\n    'shape.remove',\n    'connection.remove'\n  ], function(event) {\n\n    if (directEditing.isActive()) {\n      directEditing.cancel();\n    }\n  });\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `directEditing.isActive(event.element)` check was incorrect because `isActive` does not take an element as an argument. The correct approach is to simply check if `directEditing.isActive()` and then cancel the session if it is active. This ensures that any active direct editing session is canceled when an element is removed, preventing the illegal invocation error."
