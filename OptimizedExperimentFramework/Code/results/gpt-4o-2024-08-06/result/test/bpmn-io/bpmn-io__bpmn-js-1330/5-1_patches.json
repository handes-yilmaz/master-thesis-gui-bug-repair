    "1/1": "To address the bug where boundary events should not be message flow targets, we need to ensure that the rules in the code prevent such connections. The bug report indicates that connections to boundary events as message flow targets should be disallowed.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe provided image shows a diagram with two participants, A and B, and a boundary event attached to a task. The issue is that a message flow should not be allowed to connect to the boundary event, as per BPMN semantics. The root cause is likely a missing rule or condition in the code that should prevent message flows from targeting boundary events.\n\n### Analyzing Bug Code Snippets\n\n1. **`BoundaryEventBehavior.js`**: This file handles behaviors related to boundary events but does not seem to directly address connection rules for message flows.\n\n2. **`BpmnRules.js`**: This file contains rules for connections, including message flows. The function `canConnectMessageFlow` is likely responsible for determining if a message flow can connect to a target.\n\n### Generating Patches\n\nWe need to modify the `canConnectMessageFlow` function in `BpmnRules.js` to ensure that boundary events cannot be message flow targets.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/rules/BpmnRules.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction isMessageFlowTarget(element) {\n  return (\n    is(element, 'bpmn:InteractionNode') &&\n    !isForCompensation(element) && (\n      !is(element, 'bpmn:Event') || (\n        is(element, 'bpmn:CatchEvent') &&\n        hasEventDefinitionOrNone(element, 'bpmn:MessageEventDefinition')\n      )\n    )\n  );\n}\n=======\nfunction isMessageFlowTarget(element) {\n  return (\n    is(element, 'bpmn:InteractionNode') &&\n    !isForCompensation(element) && (\n      !is(element, 'bpmn:Event') || (\n        is(element, 'bpmn:CatchEvent') &&\n        hasEventDefinitionOrNone(element, 'bpmn:MessageEventDefinition')\n      )\n    ) &&\n    !is(element, 'bpmn:BoundaryEvent') // Disallow boundary events as targets\n  );\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a condition to the `isMessageFlowTarget` function to explicitly disallow boundary events as message flow targets, aligning with the expected behavior described in the bug report."
