        "explanation": "1. **DropOnFlowBehavior.js**: This file is specifically mentioned in the bug report and seems to be responsible for handling the behavior when shapes are dropped onto a flow. The unexpected connections are likely being managed here, especially given the repository structure and the feature name.\n\n2. **BpmnCopyPaste.js**: This file, located within the copy-paste feature, is likely involved since the bug involves copying and pasting tasks, and problems arise during this process. Any issues with copying and pasting behavior are likely implemented or can be traced in this file.",

        "explanation": "The file 'DropOnFlowBehavior.js' is directly related to the issue as it handles the behavior when elements are dropped onto a flow. The problem is with multiple shapes connecting unexpectedly, so this behavior needs inspection or modification. Additionally, 'BpmnCopyPaste.js' is likely involved since the bug specifically mentions issues occurring during the copy-paste operation, which needs to handle the copying and pasting logic correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves pasting multiple shapes onto a connection, resulting in unexpected connections. When two tasks are copied and pasted onto a sequence flow, the behavior either doesn't engage correctly or does not connect them in a logically expected manner."
