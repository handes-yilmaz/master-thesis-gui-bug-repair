    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that when multiple shapes are pasted onto a sequence flow, they are connected in a logical manner. The current behavior seems to incorrectly connect shapes or not connect them at all.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\nThe image shows a sequence flow with two tasks pasted onto it. The expected behavior is that the tasks should be connected in a meaningful way, either by not triggering the behavior for multiple shapes or by connecting them logically. The root cause likely lies in how the `DropOnFlowBehavior` handles multiple shapes during the paste operation.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\nThe relevant code is in `DropOnFlowBehavior.js`. The `insertShape` function is responsible for reconnecting shapes when they are dropped onto a flow. However, it seems to handle only single shapes, not multiple shapes. We need to modify this function to handle multiple shapes correctly.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/DropOnFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  this.postExecuted('elements.move', function(context) {\n\n    var shapes = context.shapes,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        position = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      insertShape(shapes[0], targetFlow, position);\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n=======\n  this.postExecuted('elements.move', function(context) {\n\n    var shapes = context.shapes,\n        targetFlow = context.targetFlow,\n        position = context.position;\n\n    if (targetFlow) {\n      shapes.forEach(function(shape) {\n        insertShape(shape, targetFlow, position);\n      });\n    }\n\n  }, true);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Original Code**: The `postExecuted` function only calls `insertShape` for the first shape in the `shapes` array.\n- **Modified Code**: The updated code iterates over all shapes in the `shapes` array and calls `insertShape` for each one, ensuring that all shapes are handled correctly when pasted onto a flow.\n\nThis change should ensure that multiple shapes are connected in a logical manner when pasted onto a sequence flow."
