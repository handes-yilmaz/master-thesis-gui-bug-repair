    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to ensure that adding a \"Timer Intermediate Catch Event\" to a non-default flow does not remove the \"default\" attribute from the exclusive gateway. Let's analyze the provided code snippets to identify where the issue might be occurring and generate the necessary patches.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Description:**\n   - The bug occurs when a \"Timer Intermediate Catch Event\" is added to a non-default flow, which inadvertently removes the \"default\" attribute from the exclusive gateway.\n\n2. **Root Cause:**\n   - The issue likely stems from the logic that handles the deletion or modification of sequence flows, particularly in the `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js` file. The logic might be incorrectly identifying the non-default flow as the default flow and removing the \"default\" attribute.\n\n3. **Code Snippets Analysis:**\n   - In `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js`, the `isDefaultFlow` function checks if a connection is the default flow. If it is, the default attribute is set to `null`.\n   - The logic might be too aggressive or incorrectly triggered when adding a catch event.\n\n### Patches\n\nLet's create a patch to ensure that the default attribute is not removed when a non-default flow is modified.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/features/modeling/behavior/UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    if (isDefaultFlow(connection, source)) {\n      modeling.updateProperties(source, {\n        'default': null\n      });\n    }\n=======\n    if (isDefaultFlow(connection, source) && !isCatchEvent(connection)) {\n      modeling.updateProperties(source, {\n        'default': null\n      });\n    }\n\nfunction isCatchEvent(connection) {\n  var bo = getBusinessObject(connection.target);\n  return is(bo, 'bpmn:IntermediateCatchEvent');\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification in `UnsetDefaultFlowBehavior.js`:**\n  - Added a check to ensure that the default attribute is only removed if the connection is not a catch event.\n  - Introduced a helper function `isCatchEvent` to determine if the target of the connection is a catch event.\n\nThis patch should prevent the default attribute from being removed when a catch event is added to a non-default flow, addressing the bug as described in the report."
