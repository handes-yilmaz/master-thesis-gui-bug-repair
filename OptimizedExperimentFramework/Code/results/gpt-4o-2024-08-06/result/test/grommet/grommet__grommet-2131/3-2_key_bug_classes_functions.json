        "explanation": "The issue is related to the visibility of the arrow icon on a dark background. The Select component in 'Select.js' manages the rendering of the dropdown and includes the icon rendering logic. The 'ArrowDown' function in 'ArrowDown.js' defines the SVG for the arrow icon, which uses a fixed color ('rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)'). This color does not contrast well against the dark background, causing the visibility issue. Adjusting the color property in the 'ArrowDown' function or making it configurable within the theme can resolve the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Select component's arrow icon is not visible against a dark background, making it difficult to interact with the dropdown."

The icon's color is set in 'ArrowDown.js', where the 'svg' element has a fill color of 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)', making it difficult to see on dark backgrounds. Adjusting this color or using theme variables for better contrast will resolve the issue.",
