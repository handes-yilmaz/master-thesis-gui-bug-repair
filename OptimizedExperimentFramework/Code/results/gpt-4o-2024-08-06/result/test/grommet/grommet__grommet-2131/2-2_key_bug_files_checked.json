        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/Select/Select.js**: This file contains the main Select component where the arrow icon is used. The issue might be related to how the icon is styled or rendered within this component.\n\n2. **src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js**: This file defines the ArrowDown icon used in the Select component. The color or styling of this icon might not be suitable for dark backgrounds, causing it to be invisible.\n\n3. **src/js/themes/dark.js**: This file contains the theme settings for dark mode, including color definitions. The issue might be related to the color settings for icons or other elements in dark mode, which could be causing the arrow to blend into the background.",
        "bug_scenario": "The arrow icon for the Select component is not visible on a dark background, making it difficult for users to see the dropdown indicator."
