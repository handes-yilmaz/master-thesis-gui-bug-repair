    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates that the arrow icon for the Select component is not visible on a dark background. The provided image shows a dropdown with a purple background where the arrow icon is not clearly visible, likely due to insufficient contrast between the icon color and the background.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely related to the styling of the arrow icon. In the `ArrowDown.js` file, the icon is styled with a fixed color `fill='rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)'`, which is a dark color. This color does not provide enough contrast against a dark background, making the icon hard to see.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the color of the arrow icon to ensure it is visible on dark backgrounds. We can modify the `ArrowDown.js` file to use a color from the theme or a lighter color that contrasts well with dark backgrounds.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<svg width='10' height='20' fill='rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)' {...props}>\n=======\n<svg width='10' height='20' fill='currentColor' {...props}>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change uses `currentColor`, which will inherit the text color from its parent element, allowing for better contrast management based on the theme or surrounding styles. If the theme provides a specific color for icons, it can be used instead to ensure consistency across the application."
