        "explanation": "1. 'src/js/components/Select/Select.js' and 'SelectContainer.js' are likely involved because these files define the structure and behavior of the Select component, including how the dropdown arrow is rendered and styled.\\n2. 'src/js/components/Select/stories/components/icons/ArrowDown.js' specifically deals with the arrow icon, which is crucial since it might be where the styling for the arrow is applied or needs to be adjusted for different backgrounds.\\n3. 'src/js/themes/dark.js' is involved because it manages theme styling and colors when the dark theme is applied. Adjustments might be needed here to ensure proper contrast and visibility of the arrow icon on dark backgrounds.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where the arrow icon for the 'Select' control is not visible on a dark background. The image shows a select component with a dropdown arrow that is less visible because of the color contrast issue on the dark background."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to visibility of an arrow in a Select component. The files in the Select directory, particularly `Select.js` and `SelectContainer.js`, are likely responsible for rendering and styling the Select component, including the arrow. The `theme.js` file could be configuring or defining the theme settings for the component, including color-related properties. The `colors.js` file in utils might be defining or managing the color palette used across the application, which would affect visibility issues like this.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a UI component where there is a drop-down select box with an arrow that is barely visible against a dark background. This is likely due to a styling issue where the color of the arrow does not contrast well with the background, making it difficult to see."
