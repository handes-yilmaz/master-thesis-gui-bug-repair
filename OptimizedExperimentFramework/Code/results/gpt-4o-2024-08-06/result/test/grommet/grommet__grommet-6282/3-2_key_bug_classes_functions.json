        "explanation": "The 'filterAndSortData' function in 'buildState.js' is responsible for sorting data in the DataTable component. It uses 'datumValue' to retrieve values for the sorting operation. The bug likely stems from how 'datumValue' handles null or undefined values, causing the sort function to fail when encountering such cases. Adjusting these functions to treat undefined or null as empty strings would resolve the sorting issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when sorting a data table column that contains null or undefined values. Instead of treating these values as empty strings, the sort operation fails to reorder the items correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior. The screenshot shows a data table with columns such as ID, Name, Parent, Order, and Children, where the sorting is not functioning correctly when the 'Parent' column contains null or undefined values."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to how undefined or null properties are handled during sorting. The `datumValue` function retrieves the value of a property from a data object, and it currently returns undefined if a property is missing. This function should be updated to treat undefined properties as empty strings. The `filterAndSortData` function is responsible for sorting the data based on a property. It should be modified to handle cases where the property values are undefined or null, ensuring consistent and correct sorting behavior.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a data table with columns such as ID, Name, Parent, Order, and Children. The table is supposed to allow sorting by the Parent column. However, the bug report indicates that sorting breaks when a property in the table is null or undefined, leading to unexpected behavior where items are not reordered correctly."
