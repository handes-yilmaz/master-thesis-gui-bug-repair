        "explanation": "The files related to the DataTable component are likely involved in implementing the table sorting functionality. 'DataTable.js' is the core file for the DataTable component, where the main logic likely resides. 'Sorter.js' is probably responsible for handling the sorting logic. 'buildState.js' might be involved in setting up the initial state and could affect how data is compared and sorted. Adjustments in these files can ensure that null or undefined values are treated as empty strings during sorting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The data table sorting functionality breaks when a column contains items with properties set to null or undefined. Expected sorting behavior should treat undefined properties as empty strings, but currently, the items are not reordered as expected."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue described involves sorting behavior in a DataTable component, specifically concerning null or undefined values. The relevant files likely include the main DataTable implementation file ('src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js') and possibly a sorting utility or handler within the same directory (such as 'Sorter.js'). These files would contain the logic for handling how data is displayed and sorted, which is where the bug arises.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a DataTable where sorting the 'Parent' column does not seem to reorder as expected when there are null values represented by '--'. The expected behavior is for null or undefined properties to be treated as empty strings during sorting, allowing for consistent reordering."
