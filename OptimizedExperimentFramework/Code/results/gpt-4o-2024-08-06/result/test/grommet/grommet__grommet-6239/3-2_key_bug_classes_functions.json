        "explanation": "The issue is related to the styling of the tab underlines, which is handled in the 'StyledTabsHeader' component in 'StyledTabs.js'. This component defines the CSS properties for the tabs' appearance. The 'Tabs' component in 'Tabs.js' manages the behavior and rendering of the tabs, including how they respond to dynamic content and scrolling. Adjustments in these areas are necessary to ensure the underline remains in the correct position even with scrollable content.",
        "bug_scenario": "The tabs' underline does not remain at the bottom when there is scrollable content within the tab, as shown in the images. Initially, the underline is in the correct position, but in the newer version, it moves away from the bottom, causing a visual inconsistency."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is likely related to the styling and rendering of the tabs, which involves the \"StyledTabsHeader\" and \"StyledTabPanel\" components in the StyledTabs.js file. These components control the visual layout of the tabs and their contents. The 'Tabs' function in Tabs.js is responsible for managing the tab logic, including rendering the tabs and handling their active states, which may be affected by the recent changes causing the underline misalignment.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the underlines of tabs not sticking to the bottom when there is scrollable content within the tab. This issue occurs after updating to Grommet version 2.25.0 and is visually demonstrated in the images where the underline is incorrectly positioned compared to the expected behavior."
