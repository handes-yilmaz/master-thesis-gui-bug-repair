    "1/1": "To address the issue of the `PageHeader` heading overflowing, we need to ensure that the heading text wraps instead of overflowing. This can be achieved by modifying the styling of the `Heading` component to allow text wrapping.\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario shows that the `PageHeader` heading does not wrap when the text is too long, causing it to overflow and collide with other content. The root cause is likely the CSS properties applied to the `Heading` component, which may not allow for text wrapping.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nWe need to modify the `StyledHeading` component to ensure that it allows text wrapping. This involves removing or adjusting the CSS properties that prevent wrapping, such as `white-space: nowrap`.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Heading/StyledHeading.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst truncateStyle = `\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  text-overflow: ellipsis;\n`;\n=======\nconst truncateStyle = `\n  overflow: hidden;\n  text-overflow: ellipsis;\n`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change removes the `white-space: nowrap;` property from the `truncateStyle`, allowing the text to wrap instead of being forced into a single line. This should resolve the issue of the heading text overflowing in the `PageHeader` component."
