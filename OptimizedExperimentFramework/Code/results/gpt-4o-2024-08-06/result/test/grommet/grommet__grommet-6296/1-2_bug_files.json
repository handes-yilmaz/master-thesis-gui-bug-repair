        "explanation": "The bug is related to the PageHeader component where a long string heading overflows. Relevant files include the main PageHeader component file (PageHeader.js), where the logic for handling text wrapping can be implemented or updated. The index.js and propTypes.js files ensure that any changes to props or exports can be managed. The test file (__tests__/PageHeader-test.tsx) contains related tests, which may need updating to validate the fix. The stories folder is relevant for any storybook examples that illustrate the component with various inputs, potentially requiring updates to demonstrate the fix.",

        "explanation": "The PageHeader.js file is likely where the main logic for the component resides, including how text is rendered and styled. The related story files (Custom.js, Simple.js, Responsive.js, MultipleActions.js) are important for testing and demonstrating different header configurations, and they may need adjustments to illustrate proper text wrapping. The StyledHeading.js file is relevant because it likely contains styling rules that affect how text overflow and wrapping are handled.",
        "bug_scenario": "The PageHeader component is not handling long strings properly, causing the text to overflow and collide with other elements instead of wrapping."
