        "explanation": "The issue is likely due to the styling logic within the `RadioButton` component. The `RadioButton` class handles the rendering and styling of the radio buttons, including their checked state. The bug report indicates that all radio buttons are showing the blue background color regardless of their checked state, which suggests that the condition to apply the background color based on the `checked` state is not correctly implemented in this component.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows multiple radio buttons, all with the same blue background color, which indicates that the background color is being applied to all radio buttons rather than just the checked one."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the styling of the radio buttons, specifically the application of the background color to all buttons instead of only the checked one. The `RadioButton` component in `RadioButton.js` handles the rendering and styling logic for radio buttons, including how the background color is applied. The problem likely lies in the logic that determines when to apply the checked background color, which should be conditional on the `checked` state but appears to be applied universally.",
