        "explanation": "The issue is likely in how styles are applied to the radio button component. 'RadioButton.js' handles the main logic of radio button rendering, 'StyledRadioButton.js' would handle the styling details, and 'base.js' in the themes directory might define overall style rules affecting default and checked states.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug concerns the background color of radio buttons. All radio buttons display the checked background color, rather than only the selected one."

            "src/js/components/RadioButton/StyledRadioButton.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the styling of radio buttons, where the 'check.background.color' style is being applied across all radio buttons rather than just the checked one. The files in the RadioButton component directory are responsible for the rendering and styling of radio buttons, including any checked states and associated styles. 'RadioButton.js' is likely handling the logic, and 'StyledRadioButton.js' deals with the styling, including the faulty style application.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows multiple radio buttons, all with a blue background, indicating that the style for checked radio buttons is being applied incorrectly to all radio buttons instead of just the selected one."
