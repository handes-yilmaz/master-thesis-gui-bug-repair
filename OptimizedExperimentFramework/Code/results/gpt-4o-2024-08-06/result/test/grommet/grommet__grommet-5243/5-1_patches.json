    "1/1": "To address the issue where the `check.background.color` is being applied to all radio buttons instead of just the checked one, we need to ensure that the background color is only applied when the radio button is checked.\n\n### Bug Scenario Image Description and Root Cause\nThe image shows a vertical stack of radio buttons, all with a blue background, indicating that the `check.background.color` is being applied universally rather than conditionally. The root cause is likely that the styling logic does not differentiate between checked and unchecked states for the background color.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nWe need to modify the `StyledRadioButtonBox` component to apply the background color only when the radio button is checked.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/RadioButton/RadioButton.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            > \n              {checked &&\n                (Icon ?
