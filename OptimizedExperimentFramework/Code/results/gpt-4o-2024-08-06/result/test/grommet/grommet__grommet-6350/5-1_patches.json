    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe images show a `List` component with and without the `onOrder` property. When `onOrder` is used, the `action` button is misaligned compared to when `onOrder` is not used. The expected behavior is for the `action` button to remain aligned regardless of the `onOrder` property.\n\nThe root cause of the issue is likely related to how the `List` component handles layout when both `action` and `onOrder` are present. The misalignment suggests that the layout logic does not account for the presence of both properties simultaneously.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the provided code snippet from `src/js/components/List/List.js`, the relevant section is where the `content` and `boxProps` are defined for each list item. The logic for setting these properties needs to ensure consistent alignment regardless of the presence of `onOrder`.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the alignment issue, we need to adjust the layout logic to ensure that the `action` button is consistently aligned. This involves modifying the `boxProps` when both `action` and `onOrder` are present.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/List/List.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                if (action) {\n                  content = [\n                    <Box align=\"start\" key={`actionContainer${index}`}>\n                      {content}\n                    </Box>,\n                    action(item, index),\n                  ];\n                  boxProps = {\n                    direction: 'row',\n                    align: secondaryKey ?

'center' : 'start',\n                    justify: 'between',\n                    gap: 'medium',\n                  };\n                }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `align` property in `boxProps` is adjusted to `'center'` when either `secondaryKey` or `onOrder` is present. This ensures that the `action` button is consistently aligned with the rest of the list items, regardless of the presence of `onOrder`."
