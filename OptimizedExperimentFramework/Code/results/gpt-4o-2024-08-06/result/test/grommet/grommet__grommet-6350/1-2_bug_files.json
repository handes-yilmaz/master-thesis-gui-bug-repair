        "explanation": "These files are directly related to the List component where the observed issue occurs. 'List.js' contains the implementation of the List component which likely needs modification to handle 'onOrder' and 'action' properties together. 'propTypes.js' may define prop types for validation, which needs to support 'onOrder'. 'List-test.js' likely contains tests for the List component, which may need additional tests or modification to cover the 'onOrder' functionality.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs when adding the 'onOrder' property to a List. The 'action' property doesn\u2019t align with the rest of the list, affecting the layout."

            "src/js/components/List/stories/Order.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug report describes an issue with the List component specifically when 'onOrder' and 'action' properties are used together. The 'List.js' file likely contains the List component logic where an alignment issue might be occurring when handling 'onOrder'. The 'Order.js' story file demonstrates the usage of these properties together and would be useful to verify and recreate the bug during testing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is with the alignment of the 'action' property in a List component when used with the 'onOrder' property. When 'onOrder' is present, the action buttons are misaligned within the list items. Without 'onOrder', the alignment is correct."
