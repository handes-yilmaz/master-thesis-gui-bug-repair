        "explanation": "The issue lies in the DataChart component's inability to handle negative values. The bug is related to how the component calculates bounds or renders charts when negative values are present. The DataChart.js file is likely responsible for rendering the chart and handling data normalization, which are critical in resolving the issue with negative values.",
        "bug_scenario": "The DataChart component is unable to render bars when the data includes negative values. The expected behavior is to have a zero line guide and customizable attributes for negative values, but currently, the chart displays nothing."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the rendering logic of the DataChart component, specifically how it handles data with negative values. The DataChart class is responsible for setting up and rendering the charts, including handling axis calculations, bounds, and rendering the chart components. Ensuring that negative values are correctly processed to display a zero line and customizing attributes requires modifications in this class.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a DataChart component that fails to render bar charts when the dataset includes negative values. The expectation is for the chart to have a zero line guide and allow customization of negative values, but currently, the chart displays nothing when negative values are present."
