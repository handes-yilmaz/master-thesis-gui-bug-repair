        "explanation": "The `DataTable` directory contains the main implementation files related to data tables, where the `groupBy` functionality likely needs integration. The `DataTable.js` and `GroupedBody.js` files are most relevant for implementing or updating the logic for grouping rows within the data table. The `index.js` file in the DataTable directory would need updates if there are new exports required, and the `Select.js` in the `Select` component directory might need adjustments or extension to handle the new specific usage as demonstrated in the screenshots.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a missing component `DataTableGroup` which would allow selecting a `groupBy` value for data tables. Currently, this feature seems to be executed through a `Select` component, as shown in the screenshots, where a dropdown is used to select different grouping criteria like 'Date', 'Severity', etc."

            "src/js/components/DataTable/propTypes.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The files related to the `DataTable` component are crucial because the missing `DataTableGroup` functionality would logically be implemented within the DataTable's existing structure. These files likely contain the main logic, index exports, and prop types definitions relevant to integrating a new grouping feature. Implementing a `DataTableGroup` component would require modifications and additions to these files to introduce the new functionality and handle new props as needed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue reported is the absence of a `DataTableGroup` component to provide a control for selecting the `DataTable groupBy={groupBy}` value. The provided images illustrate a user interface element that allows grouping data by different categories like Date, Severity, etc."
