        "explanation": "1. `src/js/components/DataTable/DataTable.js`: This file likely contains the main logic for the DataTable component, which would need to be modified to integrate the new `DataTableGroup` functionality.\n2. `src/js/components/DataTable/GroupedBody.js`: This file handles the grouped display of data within the DataTable, and modifications here would be necessary to support the new grouping control.\n3. `src/js/components/Select/Select.js`: The `Select` component is used to implement the dropdown menu for selecting the groupBy value, so changes here might be needed to accommodate the new `DataTableGroup` component.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates a missing `DataTableGroup` component, which is needed to provide a control for selecting the `DataTable groupBy` value. The images show a UI with a dropdown menu labeled 'Group by...' that allows users to select different grouping options for data, such as Date, Time, Type, etc."
