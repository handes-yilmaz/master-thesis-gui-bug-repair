        "explanation": "The key elements associated with the bug are within the DataTable and Select components. 'DataTable.js' is likely responsible for the main structure of data handling and display, making it a crucial file for implementing the 'DataTableGroup' functionality. 'GroupedBody.js' deals with the rendering of grouped data, which is directly related to the groupBy functionality. The 'Select.js' file is involved because the 'Select' component is used for the dropdown interface needed to choose the groupBy value. These classes need to be modified or extended to support the missing 'DataTableGroup' feature.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that a 'DataTableGroup' component is missing. This component is intended to allow users to select the 'groupBy' value for a DataTable, as exemplified by a 'Select' dropdown interface shown in the images. The images depict a user interface where a dropdown menu allows users to group data by different categories like Date, Time, Severity, etc."

            "src/js/components/Select/Select.js//Select"
        ],
        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The 'GroupedBody' class in 'GroupedBody.js' is relevant because it deals with grouping logic in data tables, which is directly related to the missing 'DataTableGroup' component. The 'Select' class in 'Select.js' is relevant because the images show that a 'Select' component is used as an example of how the 'DataTableGroup' should function, indicating that similar logic might need to be implemented or adjusted to support the new 'DataTableGroup' functionality.",
        "bug_scenario": "The images showcase a missing component, 'DataTableGroup,' which should provide a control to select the 'groupBy' value for data tables. This functionality is illustrated using a 'Select' component in the images, indicating the absence of a proper grouping control in the current implementation."
