        "explanation": "The 'Data' component in 'Data.js' manages the state and behavior of the data view, including filter settings. Its 'clearFilters' function is responsible for resetting filters, making it a key function related to the bug. The 'DataFilters' component in 'DataFilters.js' integrates filter controls and uses 'clearFilters' to reset the filters. Ensuring 'clearFilters' is correctly integrated and triggered in these components is crucial to fixing the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The 'Clear Filters' button is missing when interacting with the Data Toolbar components, such as Filter and Search. It should appear to allow users to reset filters easily."
