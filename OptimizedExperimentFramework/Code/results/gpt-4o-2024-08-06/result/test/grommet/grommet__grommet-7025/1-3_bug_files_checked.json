        "explanation": "The absence of the 'Clear Filters' button when interacting with Data Toolbar components suggests a problem in the components handling data filtering and toolbars. The key files likely involved in this issue are: \n\n1. **Data.js**: This file likely contains core logic for handling data, filtering, and rendering the relevant UI components. \n\n2. **Toolbar.js**: Toolbars facilitate interaction (like searches or filters), so the problem may lie here if these interactions aren't triggering a clear button display.\n\n3. **DataFilter.js** and **DataFilters.js**: These files handle filtering logic and UI components in the application, which is closely related to the functionality of clearing filters.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue reported is that the 'Clear Filters' button is missing when a user interacts with the Data Toolbar component (Filter, Search, etc) in the application. The images provided in the bug report demonstrate a UI where the 'Clear Filters' button is expected to appear next to search and filter options but it is absent."

        "explanation": "These files are related to the components responsible for managing data and the toolbar features within the application. The bug involves the 'Clear Filters' button not appearing correctly in the context of interacting with these components, indicating a missing or misplaced implementation. The files related to Toolbar and Data components need to be investigated and potentially modified to ensure the 'Clear Filters' button is rendered correctly across all interactions.",
        "bug_scenario": "The 'Clear Filters' button is expected to appear whenever a user interacts with the Data Toolbar, such as through filtering or searching. However, the button is missing when the user interacts as described, which means users cannot easily reset or clear filters they've applied. This issue can lead to user frustration as they must manually reset or navigate away to clear filters."
