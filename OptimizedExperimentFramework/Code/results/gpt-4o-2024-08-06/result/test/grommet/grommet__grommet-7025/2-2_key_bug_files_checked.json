        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/Data/Data.js**: This file contains the main Data component where the toolbar and its functionalities are defined. The 'clearFilters' function is defined here, which is responsible for resetting the filters. However, the integration of this function with the UI components might be missing or incorrect, leading to the absence of the 'Clear Filters' button.\n\n2. **src/js/components/DataFilters/DataFilters.js**: This file handles the DataFilters component, which is responsible for managing the filter UI and its interactions. The 'clearControl' logic is present here, which should render the 'Clear Filters' button. If this logic is not correctly implemented or integrated with the Data component, it could result in the button not appearing as expected.",
        "bug_scenario": "The 'Clear Filters' button is missing when the user interacts with the Data Toolbar components such as Filter and Search. The button should appear to allow users to clear any applied filters."
