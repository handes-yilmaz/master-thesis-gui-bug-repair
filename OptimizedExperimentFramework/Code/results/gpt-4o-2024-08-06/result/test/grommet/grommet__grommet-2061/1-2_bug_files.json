        "bug_scenario": "The problem is that the search input box within a <Select> component is displaying incorrectly on Safari. Specifically, the padding is ignored, making the input field very small compared to its appearance in Chrome."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the display of an input element within a custom Select component. The CSS property modification needs to be applied to this component to resolve the issue in Safari, suggesting that the files defining the styling or logic of the Select component are relevant.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is that the select search input is very small in Safari because padding is ignored. This was resolved in a previous version by adding a specific CSS property `-webkit-appearance: textfield;`. The screenshots show the discrepancy between Chrome (where it displays correctly) and Safari (where the input is too small)."
