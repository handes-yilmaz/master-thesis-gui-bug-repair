    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates an issue with the search input size in Safari. The input field appears smaller than expected due to Safari's default styling for search inputs. The provided images show the input field in both Safari and Chrome, with Safari ignoring the padding, making the input field appear smaller.\n\nThe root cause is that Safari applies its default styling to `<input type='search'>`, which can override custom styles. This can be resolved by adding the CSS property `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` to the input field to ensure consistent styling across browsers.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue is located in the `SelectContainer.js` file where the `TextInput` component is used with `type='search'`. We need to add the CSS property to override Safari's default styling.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Select/SelectContainer.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n              <TextInput\n                focusIndicator={true}\n                size='small'\n                ref={(ref) => { this.searchRef = ref; }}\n                type='search'\n                value={search}\n                placeholder={searchPlaceholder}\n                onInput={this.onInput}\n              />\n=======\n              <TextInput\n                focusIndicator={true}\n                size='small'\n                ref={(ref) => { this.searchRef = ref; }}\n                type='search'\n                value={search}\n                placeholder={searchPlaceholder}\n                onInput={this.onInput}\n                style={{ WebkitAppearance: 'textfield' }}\n              />\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds the `-webkit-appearance: textfield;` style to the `TextInput` component, ensuring that the input field appears correctly in Safari by overriding its default styling."
