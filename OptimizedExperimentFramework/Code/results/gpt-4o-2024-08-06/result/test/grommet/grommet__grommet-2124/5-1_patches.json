    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image shows a calendar component with misaligned and overlapping text, which is a common issue in Internet Explorer 11 due to its lack of support for modern CSS features and flexbox inconsistencies. The root cause is likely related to CSS styles not being applied correctly or not being compatible with IE11.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely in the CSS styling of the calendar component. The relevant code snippets are in `StyledCalendar.js`, where the styles for the calendar are defined. The use of flexbox and other modern CSS features might not be fully supported in IE11, leading to the display issues.\n\n### Patches for Bug Code Snippets\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the CSS is compatible with IE11. This can involve using more traditional layout techniques or ensuring that flexbox is used in a way that is compatible with IE11.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const StyledWeek = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  flex-justify: between;\n`;\n=======\nexport const StyledWeek = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  justify-content: space-between; /* Corrected property name */\n`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Calendar/StyledCalendar.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nexport const StyledDay = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  ${props => daySizeStyle(props)}\n  ${props => props.background && backgroundStyle(props.background, props.theme)}\n  ${props => props.otherMonth && 'opacity: 0.5;'}\n`;\n=======\nexport const StyledDay = styled.div`\n  display: inline-block; /* Changed from flex to inline-block for IE11 compatibility */\n  text-align: center; /* Center text horizontally */\n  vertical-align: middle; /* Center text vertically */\n  ${props => daySizeStyle(props)}\n  ${props => props.background && backgroundStyle(props.background, props.theme)}\n  ${props => props.otherMonth && 'opacity: 0.5;'}\n`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes aim to improve compatibility with IE11 by adjusting the CSS properties to more traditional layout techniques and correcting any potential misuses of flexbox properties."
