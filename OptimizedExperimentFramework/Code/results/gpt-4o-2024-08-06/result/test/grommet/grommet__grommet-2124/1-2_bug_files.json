        "explanation": "The Calendar.js is the main file for the Calendar component and is likely where the issue originates. Utils.js could contain utility functions impacting how dates are rendered. StyledCalendar.js deals with styles which could affect how elements appear, especially in a browser with limited CSS support like IE11.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Grommet2 Calendar component is not displaying properly in Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). The visual in the image shows distorted date entries, and possibly misaligned or missing days within the calendar component, indicating improper rendering in the browser."

            "src/js/components/Calendar/utils.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Calendar component not displaying properly in IE11. The files most likely responsible for rendering and styling the Calendar component are in the Calendar directory. 'Calendar.js' manages the logic and structure of the calendar, 'StyledCalendar.js' handles the styling which could be impacted by IE11's CSS limitations, and 'utils.js' might have utility functions that could affect date formatting or visualization.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Calendar component in Grommet2 is not rendering correctly in Internet Explorer 11. The days of the month are not displayed properly, and the calendar layout looks broken as exhibited in the screenshot."
