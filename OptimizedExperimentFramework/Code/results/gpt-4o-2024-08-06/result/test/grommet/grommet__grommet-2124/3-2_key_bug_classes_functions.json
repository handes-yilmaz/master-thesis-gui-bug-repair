        "explanation": "The `Calendar` class in `Calendar.js` is responsible for rendering the calendar component and managing its state. Since the issue is with the display in IE11, the rendering logic needs to be examined. The `StyledCalendar` in `StyledCalendar.js` handles the styling of the calendar, which is crucial for display issues, especially in older browsers like IE11. CSS styles might not be compatible or need specific adjustments for IE11. The `sameDay` and `betweenDates` functions in `utils.js` are used extensively for date calculations and may contribute to logic issues if they behave differently in IE11.",
        "bug_scenario": "The calendar in Internet Explorer 11 does not display properly. The screenshot shows a calendar with misaligned dates and symbols, which indicates a possible CSS or rendering issue in the IE11 browser."

        ],
        "explanation": "The 'Calendar' class in 'Calendar.js' is central to the calendar's functionality and rendering. The 'buildStartEnd' and 'buildState' functions are responsible for setting up the initial state and layout of the calendar, including determining the start and end dates. The 'render' function is responsible for drawing the calendar on the screen, making it a crucial area to investigate layout issues on IE11.",
        "bug_scenario": "The calendar is not displaying properly in IE11. The image shows a broken calendar layout with misaligned or missing elements."
