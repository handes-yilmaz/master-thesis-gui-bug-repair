        "explanation": "The files likely responsible for this bug are related to the DataTable component, particularly the header and sorting logic. 'Header.js' manages the display of column headers, which includes the sorting arrows that should change based on URL parameters. 'Sorter.js' contains the sorting logic, which needs to synchronize with URL-based sorting parameters. 'DataTable.js' integrates these functionalities and needs adjustments to ensure that the sorting arrow states update correctly with URL changes, especially when using browser navigation.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue involves DataTable sorting, where the sorting arrows in the header do not reflect changes made to the URL when using browser navigation. This inconsistency occurs after sorting columns in the table and using browser navigation buttons (back/forward)."

            "src/js/components/DataTable/Sorter.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are part of the DataTable component that is responsible for header actions, table display, and sorting logic. The Header.js handles interactions with the table header, which includes sorting operations. DataTable.js manages general table behavior and would need to track state changes related to sorting and URL updates. Sorter.js likely contains logic for sorting and would be directly responsible for ensuring the arrow's state reflects the URL's sorting parameters.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a sorting arrow icon in the DataTable header not updating correctly when sorted using table headers or when navigating with browser arrows. The URL updates correctly, but the visual state of the sorting arrow icon does not reflect these changes, causing inconsistency between the URL and the UI."
