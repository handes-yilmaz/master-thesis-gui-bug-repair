        ],
        "explanation": "The issue seems to be related to how sorting state changes are handled and reflected in the UI. The 'Header' class in 'Header.js' manages the display and interaction of the table headers, including sorting. The 'onSort' function appears to be responsible for handling sort actions, which should update the sorting icon. The 'Sorter' component in 'Sorter.js' is also relevant as it directly deals with sorting UI elements, including rendering the sorting icon. Ensuring these components correctly update the icon based on the sorting state is crucial to resolving the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the sorting arrow icon in a DataTable header not updating correctly when sorting is performed or when using browser navigation. The URL changes to reflect the sorting parameters, but the header arrows do not update to match the sorting state indicated by the URL."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue lies in the DataTable component where the header arrow icons do not update to reflect the current sorting state from the URL. The 'Header' component in 'Header.js' manages the header display and sorting indicators, which need to respond to URL changes. The 'Sorter' component in 'Sorter.js' handles the sorting logic and icon rendering. Both components need to be modified to ensure the sorting state is synchronized with the URL, updating the arrows accordingly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The sorting arrow icon in the DataTable header doesn't update when using browser navigation. The URL changes with sorting parameters, but the header arrows do not reflect these changes."
