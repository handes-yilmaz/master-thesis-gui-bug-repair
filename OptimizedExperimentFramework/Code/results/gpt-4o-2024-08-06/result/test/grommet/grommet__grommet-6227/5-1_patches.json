    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the form validation correctly updates when fields are dynamically added or removed. The problem seems to be that the form remains invalid even after a required field is removed.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nIn the provided GIF, when the checkbox is toggled, a required text input field is added or removed. The form should be valid when the required field is removed, assuming all other fields are valid. However, the form remains invalid, indicating that the validation state is not updated correctly when fields are removed.\n\nThe root cause is likely related to how the form validation state is managed, particularly when fields are dynamically removed. The validation results for removed fields are not being cleared properly, causing the form to remain in an invalid state.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue is likely in the `filterRemovedFields` function, which is supposed to clean up validation results for fields that are no longer present in the form. We need to ensure that this function correctly removes validation results for fields that have been removed.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Form/Form.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst filterRemovedFields = (prevValidations) => {\n  const nextValidations = prevValidations;\n  return Object.keys(nextValidations)\n    .filter(\n      (n) =>\n        !validationRulesRef.current[n] || nextValidations[n] === undefined,\n    )\n    .forEach((n) => delete nextValidations[n]);\n};\n=======\nconst filterRemovedFields = (prevValidations) => {\n  const nextValidations = { ...prevValidations };\n  Object.keys(nextValidations)\n    .filter((n) => !validationRulesRef.current[n])\n    .forEach((n) => delete nextValidations[n]);\n  return nextValidations;\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Code**: The `filterRemovedFields` function was modifying the `prevValidations` object directly and returning a filtered list, which was incorrect.\n- **Updated Code**: The function now creates a copy of `prevValidations` and correctly removes entries for fields that are no longer present in `validationRulesRef.current`. It returns the updated validations object, ensuring that the form's validation state is accurate after fields are removed."
