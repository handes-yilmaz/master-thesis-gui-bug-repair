    "1/1": "To address the issue of misalignment between the name and value in the `NameValuePair` component, we need to ensure that both elements are vertically centered. The bug scenario image shows that the text \"File log level\" and the dropdown are not aligned properly.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe misalignment is likely due to the lack of consistent vertical alignment settings for the name and value elements within the `NameValuePair` component. The `align` property should be applied consistently to both elements to ensure they are centered.\n\n### Bug Fix\nWe need to modify the `NameValuePair` component to ensure that both the name and value are aligned vertically. This can be achieved by setting the `align` property for both the `name` and `value` elements.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      <Box as=\"dt\" align={nameAlign}>\n=======\n      <Box as=\"dt\" align={nameAlign} justify=\"center\">\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      <Box margin=\"none\" as=\"dd\" align={valueAlign}>\n=======\n      <Box margin=\"none\" as=\"dd\" align={valueAlign} justify=\"center\">\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Name Alignment**: Added `justify=\"center\"` to the `Box` containing the name to ensure vertical centering.\n- **Value Alignment**: Added `justify=\"center\"` to the `Box` containing the value to ensure vertical centering.\n\nThese changes should align the name and value elements vertically, resolving the misalignment issue."
