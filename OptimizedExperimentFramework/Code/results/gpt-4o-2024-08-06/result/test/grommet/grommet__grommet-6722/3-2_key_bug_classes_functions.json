        "explanation": "The 'NameValueList' class manages the layout configuration, including alignment and column settings, which are crucial for ensuring horizontal alignment of elements. The 'NameValuePair' class handles the individual name and value alignment properties, using 'textAlign' and 'align' attributes, which directly affect the vertical positioning of these elements. Adjustments in these classes can directly resolve the misalignment issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows misalignment between the 'Name' and 'Value' elements in a NameValuePair component. The 'Name' appears higher than the 'Value', indicating they are not horizontally centered as expected."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The issue lies in the alignment of the Name and Value in the NameValuePair component. The alignment properties are set in both NameValueList and NameValuePair components. In NameValueList.js, the 'columns' and 'align' properties in the Grid component influence the layout. In NameValuePair.js, the 'nameAlign' and 'valueAlign' properties affect the alignment of the text elements. These elements need to be adjusted to ensure the Name and Value are horizontally centered and aligned correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Name and value of NameValuePair are not aligned correctly in column mode. The Name (File log level) and the selected value (Debug) are on different vertical positions, but they should be horizontally centered and aligned."
