        "explanation": "1. **src/js/components/NameValueList/NameValueList.js**: This file contains the NameValueList component, which is responsible for setting up the layout and alignment properties for the NameValuePair components. The misalignment issue could be due to incorrect column or alignment settings in this component.\n\n2. **src/js/components/NameValuePair/NameValuePair.js**: This file contains the NameValuePair component, which directly handles the rendering of the 'Name' and 'Value' elements. The alignment properties for these elements are likely set here, and any misconfiguration could lead to the observed misalignment.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves misalignment between the 'Name' and 'Value' in a NameValuePair component. The expected behavior is for both elements to be horizontally centered, but currently, they are not aligned properly, as shown in the image."
