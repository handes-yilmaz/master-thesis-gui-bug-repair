    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image shows a slider (RangeInput) that is not centered within its container (FormField). The slider extends beyond the edge of the container, which is not the expected behavior. The issue is likely related to the styling of the RangeInput component, specifically how the width and alignment are handled.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely in the `StyledRangeInput` component within the `StyledRangeInput.js` file. The `width` and `alignment` properties of the slider might not be correctly set, causing it to extend beyond its container.\n\n### Patches for Bug Fix\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `StyledRangeInput` component is properly centered within its container. This can be achieved by adjusting the CSS properties related to width and alignment.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/RangeInput/StyledRangeInput.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  width: 100%;\n  padding: 0px;\n  cursor: ${(props) => (props.disabled ? 'default' : 'pointer')};\n=======\n  width: calc(100% - ${(props) => props.theme.global.spacing});\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 0;\n  cursor: ${(props) => (props.disabled ? 'default' : 'pointer')};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Width Adjustment**: The width is adjusted to account for the spacing of the thumb, ensuring the slider does not extend beyond the container.\n- **Centering**: The `margin: 0 auto;` centers the slider within its container.\n- **Padding**: Ensures no extra padding affects the alignment.\n\nThese changes should ensure that the RangeInput is properly centered and contained within the FormField."
