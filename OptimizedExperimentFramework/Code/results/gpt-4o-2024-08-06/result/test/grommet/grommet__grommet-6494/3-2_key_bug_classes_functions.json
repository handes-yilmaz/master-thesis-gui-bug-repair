        "explanation": "The issue is related to the layout and styling of the RangeInput component within a FormField. The `RangeInput` component in `RangeInput.js` manages the input's properties such as focus and value, which might affect its positioning. The `StyledRangeInput` in `StyledRangeInput.js` controls the CSS styling, including track and thumb styles, which are crucial for ensuring the input is centered and correctly sized. Adjustments in these areas are necessary to ensure the RangeInput is properly contained and centered within its parent FormField.",
        "bug_scenario": "The RangeInput component is not centered within the FormField and extends beyond its edge, affecting visual alignment."

        "explanation": "The RangeInput component is responsible for rendering the range input element. The issue of it being off-center and extending beyond the FormField suggests that the component's styling or positioning logic may be incorrect. The FormContext and focusIndicator properties in RangeInput.js may also affect its positioning within FormField. StyledRangeInput.js defines the styling of the range input, including width and margin, which are crucial for the visual alignment within the parent FormField. Adjusting these may resolve the centering issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The RangeInput within the FormField is visually off-center, extending beyond the FormField boundaries, particularly noticeable in the HPE theme."
