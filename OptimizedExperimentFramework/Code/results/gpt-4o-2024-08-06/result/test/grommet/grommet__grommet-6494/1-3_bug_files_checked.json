        "explanation": "The issue involves the positioning and styling of the RangeInput component within the FormField. Therefore, the RangeInput.js and StyledRangeInput.js files are critical as they handle the functionality and styling of the RangeInput component. FormField.js is included because it governs the layout and styling of the FormField container which houses the RangeInput. Additionally, theme files such as hpe.js and grommet.js are relevant since they may contain styling configurations affecting the presentation of these components.",
        "bug_scenario": "The RangeInput component, as seen in the image and described in the bug report, extends beyond the edge of the FormField and is not centered. This misalignment occurs in both the grommet and hpe themes, but it is more noticeable in the hpe theme."

            "src/js/themes/grommet.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are likely to contain styling or layout logic impacting the RangeInput and FormField, which could be causing the off-center and out-of-bounds issue. The theme files might also affect this, as the problem is noticeable across different themes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a RangeInput component where the slider is not centered within the FormField, extending beyond its bounds. This aligns with the bug report that states the RangeInput is not contained properly within the FormField, observed more clearly in the HPE theme."
