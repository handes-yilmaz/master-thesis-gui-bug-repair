    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to focus on the error message: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')`. This error typically occurs when trying to access a property of an undefined variable. The problem arises when using `border=\"between\"` and a `gap` size in pixels.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe error occurs when the `Box` component is used with `border=\"between\"` and a `gap` specified in pixels. The expected behavior is for the `Box` to apply half the value of `gap` around the separator line, but instead, it throws a TypeError.\n\n### Bug Location and Root Cause\n\nThe issue likely stems from the handling of the `gap` property when it is specified in pixels. The code attempts to parse the `gap` value, but it may not handle pixel values correctly, leading to an undefined variable when trying to read properties like `match`.\n\n### Fixing the Bug\n\nWe need to ensure that the `gap` value is correctly parsed and handled, especially when specified in pixels. Let's look at the relevant code snippets and make the necessary adjustments.\n\n### Patches\n\n#### File: `src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js`\n\nWe'll modify the `gapStyle` function to handle pixel values correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Box/StyledBox.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst gapStyle = (directionProp, gap, responsive, border, theme) => {\n  const metric = theme.global.edgeSize[gap] || gap;\n  const breakpoint = getBreakpointStyle(theme, theme.box.responsiveBreakpoint);\n  const responsiveMetric = responsive && breakpoint && breakpoint.edgeSize[gap];\n=======\nconst gapStyle = (directionProp, gap, responsive, border, theme) => {\n  const metric = theme.global.edgeSize[gap] || (gap.match(/px$/) ? gap : theme.global.edgeSize[gap]);\n  const breakpoint = getBreakpointStyle(theme, theme.box.responsiveBreakpoint);\n  const responsiveMetric = responsive && breakpoint && (breakpoint.edgeSize[gap] || (gap.match(/px$/) ? gap : breakpoint.edgeSize[gap]));\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Parsing Pixel Values**: The `gapStyle` function now checks if the `gap` value ends with `px` using `gap.match(/px$/)`. If it does, it uses the pixel value directly; otherwise, it falls back to the theme's predefined sizes.\n- **Responsive Handling**: Similarly, for responsive metrics, it checks for pixel values and handles them appropriately.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by ensuring that pixel values for `gap` are correctly parsed and applied, preventing the `TypeError`."
