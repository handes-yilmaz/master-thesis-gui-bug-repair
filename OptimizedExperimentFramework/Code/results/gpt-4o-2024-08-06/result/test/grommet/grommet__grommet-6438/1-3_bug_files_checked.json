        "explanation": "The files `DateInput.js` and `utils.js` within the `DateInput` directory are responsible for managing the date picker functionality and utility operations. The issue lies in these components not enforcing the date selection bounds properly, leading to the bug where dates outside the specified range can be selected.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug allows selection of days outside the specified bounds in the `DateInput` component. The image shows a date picker where the date 30th June can be selected even though the bounds are July 1st to July 31st, 2020."

            "src/js/utils/dates.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is likely related to the DateInput or Calendar components, as they manage date selections and display. The DateInput.js file would handle input constraints, while Calendar.js would manage the display logic of the calendar days. Any utility functions related to date operations might also be in src/js/utils/dates.js, affecting how dates are validated and displayed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The calendar allows selecting a date (June 30, 2020) that is outside the specified bounds (July 1 to July 31, 2020)."
