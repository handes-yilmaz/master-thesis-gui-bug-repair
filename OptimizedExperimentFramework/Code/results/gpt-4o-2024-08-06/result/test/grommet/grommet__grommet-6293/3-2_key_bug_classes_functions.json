        "explanation": "The issue is likely within the 'Circle' component, as it is responsible for rendering the 'circle' type meter. The logic that determines how values are translated into visual segments might be faulty, causing only the last value to render. The file 'Circle.js' contains the rendering logic for these segments, indicating it is the key area to investigate and fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario shows that when using the Meter component with type 'circle', not all values are rendered. The first image shows the expected behavior with multiple segments displayed, while the second image shows the bug with only a single segment rendered."

            "src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js//Circle"
        ],
        "explanation": "The `Meter` component is responsible for rendering the meter using different types. The logic for rendering circle meters is handled within the `Circle` component. The issue arises with how values are processed and rendered in these components. In `Circle.js`, the loop that processes values seems to result in only the last value being rendered, which aligns with the described bug. The `Meter` component passes these values to `Circle`, so both need to be examined to ensure all values are properly handled and rendered.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug affects the rendering of a circular meter where not all data points are displayed. In the working version, each data point has a distinct segment in the circle, but in the broken version, only the last data point is rendered, resulting in a single-color circle."
