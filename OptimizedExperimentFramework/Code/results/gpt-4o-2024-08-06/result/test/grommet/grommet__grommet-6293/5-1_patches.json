    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report and images indicate that the `Meter` component with `type=\"circle\"` is not rendering all data points correctly. In the first image, all values are displayed, while in the second image, only the last value is rendered. This issue started occurring in version `v2.25.0` of the Grommet library.\n\nThe root cause seems to be related to how the `endAngle` is calculated and how paths are managed in the `Circle` component. The logic for drawing paths might be incorrectly handling the angles or the order of rendering, causing only the last segment to be visible.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippets are in `src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js` and `src/js/components/Meter/Meter.js`. The issue likely resides in the `Circle.js` file, particularly in the loop that processes each value and calculates the `endAngle`.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that each segment is correctly calculated and rendered. The problem might be with the `endAngle` calculation or the way paths are added to the `paths` array.\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Meter/Circle.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      if (startValue + value >= max) {\n        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;\n      } else {\n        endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);\n      }\n=======\n      endAngle = translateEndAngle(startAngle, anglePer, value);\n      if (endAngle > (type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360)) {\n        endAngle = type === 'semicircle' ? 90 : 360;\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the `endAngle` is calculated for each value and adjusted if it exceeds the maximum angle for the circle or semicircle. This should allow all segments to be rendered correctly."
