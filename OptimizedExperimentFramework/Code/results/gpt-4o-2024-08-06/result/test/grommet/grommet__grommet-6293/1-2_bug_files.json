        "explanation": "The bug relates to the rendering of the Meter component, specifically when using type 'circle'. The relevant files are located in the 'src/js/components/Meter/' directory. 'Meter.js' is the main component file, while 'Circle.js' is responsible for rendering circles. 'StyledMeter.js' includes the styling, which might affect rendering, and 'utils.js' contains utility functions possibly related to calculations or rendering logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue arises when using the Meter component with type 'circle'. In version 2.25.0, only the last value is rendered, while in the previous version all values were displayed correctly."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the 'Meter' component, specifically when rendering in a 'circle' type. The 'Meter.js' file is the core file for the Meter component, 'Circle.js' handles circle-specific rendering logic, and 'utils.js' includes utility functions that might influence how values are processed and displayed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a 'Meter' component with type 'circle' that should render multiple data points but only renders the last one. The expected behavior is seen in version 2.24.0 where all values are shown, while the issue occurs in version 2.25.0."
