        "explanation": "The issue lies in the `DataFilters` component, specifically in how it handles the display of filter options. Currently, the filters are shown in a dropdown, which causes overflow. To address this, a new 'layer' prop should be introduced to allow rendering filters in a separate layer, providing more space. This requires changes to the `DataFilters` component's logic and UI structure.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario shows a UI issue where the filters overflow in the dropdown menu, making it difficult for users to interact with all available filters. The expected behavior is to have a 'layer' prop that allows filters to be displayed in a separate, larger layer, providing more space and improving usability."

        ],
        "explanation": "The DataFilters component currently only supports a 'drop' prop for dropdown menu selection. The issue arises because it lacks a 'layer' prop to allow displaying filters in a separate layer. The solution requires modifications in the DataFilters component to introduce and handle a new 'layer' prop, which will provide more space for filters and prevent overflow.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the DataFilters component not providing an option to display filters in a separate layer, causing them to overflow in the dropdown menu."
