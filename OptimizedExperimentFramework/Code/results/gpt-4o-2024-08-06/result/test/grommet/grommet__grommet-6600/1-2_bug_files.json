        "explanation": "The issue is with the `DataFilters` component, as it lacks a `layer` prop to present filters in a separate overlay or layer. The following files are bug-related: 1. `DataFilters.js`: This file likely contains the implementation code for the `DataFilters` component where new logic or presentation layers can be added. 2. `propTypes.js`: This file defines the properties that `DataFilters` can accept, and it would need to be updated to include the new `layer` prop. Changes in these files are necessary to implement the feature that meets the expected behavior.",
        "bug_scenario": "The current `DataFilters` component uses a dropdown that does not accommodate a large number of filters as it causes an overflow, making it difficult for users to view all the filter options. The expected behavior is to have a `layer` prop that allows the user to display filters in a separate layer, providing more space and preventing overflow issues."

        ],
        "explanation": "The suspected files are related to the DataFilters component. These are most likely handling properties and rendering logic for the DataFilters component. Modifications would need to be made to include and handle a `layer` prop to allow displaying the filters in a separate layer instead of the dropdown to resolve the overflow issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the DataFilters component where filters are overflowing in the dropdown menu when there are many filters. The expected behavior is to have a `layer` prop to allow displaying filters in a separate layer, as demonstrated in the provided screenshot. However, the current setup only supports a `drop` prop, and this causes a visual overflow issue in the dropdown."
