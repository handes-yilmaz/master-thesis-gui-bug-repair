    "1/1": "To address the issue with the circle meter path animation, we need to modify the transition property in the `StyledMeter.js` file. The current transition is causing the strange animation behavior. Let's update it to only transition the stroke-dashoffset property, which should smooth out the animation.\n\nHere's the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/js/components/Meter/StyledMeter.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  path {\n    transition: all 0.3s;\n  }\n=======\n  path {\n    transition: stroke-dashoffset 0.3s;\n  }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Bug Scenario**: The animation of the circle meter is not smooth due to the `transition: all 0.3s;` property, which affects all properties of the path, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\n2. **Bug Root Cause**: The `transition: all` is causing the entire path to animate, which is not desired. We only want to animate the `stroke-dashoffset` to achieve a smooth transition effect.\n\n3. **Fix**: By changing the transition to `stroke-dashoffset 0.3s;`, we ensure that only the stroke-dashoffset property is animated, resulting in a smoother and more controlled animation."
