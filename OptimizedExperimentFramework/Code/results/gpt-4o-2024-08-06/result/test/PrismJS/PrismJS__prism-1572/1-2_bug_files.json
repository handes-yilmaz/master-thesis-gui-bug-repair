        "explanation": "To add G-code syntax highlighting, a new language definition file should be created for the G-code syntax within the components directory, following the structure and naming conventions of existing language files. The specific rules for comments, keywords, and parameters in G-code need to be implemented in a new file such as 'prism-gcode.js' and its minified version, using the example implementation as a reference.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report requests adding G-code syntax highlighting to the Prism library. G-code is a numerical control programming language used in 3D printing and CNC machining. The bug scenario image shows a snippet of G-code, demonstrating common commands and syntax, highlighting the need for specific language rules such as commands starting with 'G' or 'M' and parameters like 'X', 'Y', 'Z', etc."

        ],
        "explanation": "1. **components/index.js**: This file likely serves as an entry point for registering and initializing all language components, so adding a new language definition would require modifications here.\n2. **prism.js**: This is the core library file where support for additional languages could be inserted directly, possibly by adding the provided G-code syntax definition.\n3. **components.js**: If this file aggregates or configures the various components, it may need to be updated to include or reference the new G-code component for syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The request is to add G-code syntax highlighting support to the existing Prism library. The image shows a typical G-code example where the syntax highlighting needs to be applied, clearly showing the differentiation between commands like \"M190\", \"G21\", and parameters like \"S60\" and \"E15\"."
