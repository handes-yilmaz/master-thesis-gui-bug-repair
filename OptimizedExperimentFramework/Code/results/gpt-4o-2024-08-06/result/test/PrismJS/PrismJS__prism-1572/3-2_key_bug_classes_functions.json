        "explanation": "The 'languages' object in 'components.js' is where all language definitions are stored. To support G-code highlighting, a new entry for 'gcode' needs to be added here. The 'loadLanguages' function in 'components/index.js' is responsible for loading language definitions into Prism. It would need to be updated to recognize and load the new 'gcode' language syntax definition.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report requests adding G-code syntax highlighting to Prism.js with a language identifier of 'gcode'. The provided code snippet shows a simple implementation for Reprap G-code syntax highlighting, and there is an image showing the expected syntax highlighting style for G-code commands. This highlights various commands and parameters with different colors for better readability."

        "explanation": "The request is to add G-code syntax highlighting to the Prism library. This involves adding a new language definition for G-code to the list of supported languages. The necessary changes would likely involve adding G-code to the `components.js` file, where languages are defined, to ensure it's recognized by the system. Additionally, modifications to the `loadLanguages` function in `components/index.js` might be required to ensure that the new language can be properly loaded and its dependencies managed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows G-code syntax with numerical control commands for 3D printing. The request is to add G-code syntax highlighting to the Prism library with the identifier `gcode`. The existing implementation for this highlighting is provided in a snippet."
