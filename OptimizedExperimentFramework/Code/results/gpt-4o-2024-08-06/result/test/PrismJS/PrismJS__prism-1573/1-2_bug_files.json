        "explanation": "The issue is specific to F# syntax highlighting. The files 'prism-fsharp.js' and 'prism-fsharp.min.js' are responsible for the F# language support in the project. Modifying these files would address the missing type annotation highlighting, ensuring that F# code is correctly parsed and styled in the editor.",
        "bug_scenario": "The F# type annotations in the editor are not being highlighted as expected. The first image shows F# code with no color highlighting applied to type annotations such as 'int' and 'double'. The second image demonstrates the desired outcome with proper highlighting."

            "components/prism-fsharp.min.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue involves syntax highlighting for F# specifically, which would be handled in files related to F# language support within the repository. The relevant files for F# syntax highlighting are `prism-fsharp.js` and its minified version `prism-fsharp.min.js`. These files would contain the necessary logic to handle the proper colorization of F# type annotations.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to F# type annotations not being highlighted properly in the code editor, as shown in the first image. The desired highlighting, similar to Visual Studio, is depicted in the second image where type annotations are distinctively colored."
