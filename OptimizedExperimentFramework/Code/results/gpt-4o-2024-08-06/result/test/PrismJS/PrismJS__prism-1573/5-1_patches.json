    "1/1": "To address the issue of F# type annotations not being highlighted, we need to modify the syntax highlighting rules in the `components/prism-fsharp.js` file. The bug report indicates that type annotations are not being recognized, which suggests that the current language definition does not include rules for highlighting type annotations.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\n\nThe images show a comparison between two code editors. The first image lacks syntax highlighting for type annotations in F#, while the second image (from Visual Studio) correctly highlights them. This indicates that the syntax highlighting rules in the first editor are incomplete or missing specific patterns for type annotations.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe `components/prism-fsharp.js` file contains the language definition for F# in Prism. The current rules cover comments, keywords, strings, and numbers, but do not explicitly handle type annotations. We need to add a rule to recognize and highlight type annotations.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nWe will add a new pattern to the F# language definition to match type annotations. Type annotations in F# typically follow the pattern `: type`, where `type` can be any valid type name.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-fsharp.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('fsharp', 'keyword', {\n    'preprocessor': {\n        pattern: /^[^\\r\\n\\S]*#.*/m,\n        alias: 'property',\n        inside: {\n            'directive': {\n                pattern: /(\\s*#)\\b(?:else|endif|if|light|line|nowarn)\\b/,\n                lookbehind: true,\n                alias: 'keyword'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n=======\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('fsharp', 'keyword', {\n    'type-annotation': {\n        pattern: /:\\s*\\b(?:[A-Z][\\w']*|int|float|double|string|bool|unit|list|array|seq|option|ref|result|choice|map|set)\\b/,\n        alias: 'class-name'\n    },\n    'preprocessor': {\n        pattern: /^[^\\r\\n\\S]*#.*/m,\n        alias: 'property',\n        inside: {\n            'directive': {\n                pattern: /(\\s*#)\\b(?:else|endif|if|light|line|nowarn)\\b/,\n                lookbehind: true,\n                alias: 'keyword'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n});\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a new pattern for type annotations, which will match common F# types and highlight them as class names. This should resolve the issue of missing syntax highlighting for type annotations in F#."
