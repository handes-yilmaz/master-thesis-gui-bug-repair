        "explanation": "The bug is related to syntax highlighting for F# type annotations. The files 'components/prism-fsharp.js' and 'components/prism-fsharp.min.js' are responsible for defining the language syntax rules for F# in the Prism library. These files contain the definitions for keywords, strings, numbers, and other syntax elements that need to be highlighted. To fix the bug, modifications to the type annotations' regex patterns or additional highlighting rules might be necessary in these files.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue where F# type annotations are not highlighted as expected. The provided images show the difference between the current state and the desired result. In the current state, there is no syntax highlighting for type annotations, while in the desired result, the type annotations are distinctly highlighted in a different color, improving readability."

        "explanation": "The issue arises from the lack of syntax highlighting for F# type annotations. The key file is `components/prism-fsharp.js`, which contains the syntax definitions for F# in the Prism library. Modifications to this file are necessary to ensure that type annotations are correctly highlighted, similar to how they appear in Visual Studio. The bug likely resides in the definitions of patterns and keywords used for highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario is that F# type annotations are not being highlighted correctly in one setting, while they are highlighted in the desired manner in Visual Studio. The images show a comparison between the incorrect and correct syntax highlighting of F# type annotations."
