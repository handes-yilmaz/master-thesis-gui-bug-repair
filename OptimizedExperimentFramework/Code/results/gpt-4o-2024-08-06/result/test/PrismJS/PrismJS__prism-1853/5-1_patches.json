    "1/1": "The issue described in the bug report is related to incorrect tokenization of JSON data, specifically when encountering the string `\"/*\"`. This is being incorrectly interpreted as the start of a comment, which is not valid in JSON.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe problem arises because the regular expression for comments in the `prism-json.js` file is matching the `\"/*\"` string as a comment. In JSON, comments are not allowed, so the tokenizer should not be interpreting `\"/*\"` as a comment.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-json.js` file, specifically in the regular expression pattern for comments.\n\n### Patch\nTo fix this issue, we need to remove the comment pattern from the JSON language definition in Prism, as JSON does not support comments.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-json.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.json = {\n\t'comment': /\\/\\/.*|\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?(?:\\*\\/|$)/,\n\t'property': {\n=======\nPrism.languages.json = {\n\t'property': {\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch removes the comment pattern from the JSON language definition, ensuring that strings like `\"/*\"` are not incorrectly tokenized as comments."
