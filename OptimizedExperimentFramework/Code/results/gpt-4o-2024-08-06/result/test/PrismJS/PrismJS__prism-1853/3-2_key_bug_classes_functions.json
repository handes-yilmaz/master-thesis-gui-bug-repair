        "explanation": "The issue lies in the tokenization rules defined for JSON in 'components/prism-json.js'. The pattern for comments likely interferes with strings containing '/*'. The 'comment' pattern is not correctly distinguishing between comments and strings that contain similar patterns, causing incorrect highlighting.",

        "explanation": "The problem is related to JSON tokenization where the '/*' is being interpreted incorrectly. In 'components/prism-json.js', the language definition for JSON includes patterns for comments, which are likely causing this misinterpretation. The 'comment' pattern defined as /\\/\\/.*|\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?(?:\\*\\/|$)/ may be incorrectly matching '/*' within the JSON string, leading to the tokenization issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a JSON object being logged. The issue occurs when the HTTP header 'Accept: */*' causes incorrect syntax highlighting. The JSON key 'A' with value '/*' is being misinterpreted, likely due to it being mistaken for the start of a comment."
