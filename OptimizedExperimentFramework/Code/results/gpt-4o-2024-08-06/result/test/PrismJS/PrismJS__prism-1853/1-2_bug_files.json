        "explanation": "The files related to JSON handling in the Prism repository are likely responsible for processing and highlighting JSON content. These include `components/prism-json.js` and possibly `components/prism-jsx.js`, as JSX may involve JSON-like structures. The main `prism.js` file could also be involved since it orchestrates parsing and tokenization across different languages, and may need adjustments to handle special cases like `/*` inside JSON strings.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with JSON tokenization in Prism. Specifically, the problem arises when logging a server response as JSON, where the HTTP header `Accept: */*` causes incorrect highlighting. The image shows that the string containing `/*` is incorrectly highlighted, as if it were the beginning of a comment."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue involves JSON tokenization, which is likely handled by the files responsible for JSON syntax in Prism, specifically 'components/prism-json.js'. The core logic for tokenization might also involve 'components/prism-core.js', as this file typically handles the fundamental tokenization processes for different languages in Prism.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is with the JSON tokenization in Prism, where it fails to properly highlight JSON strings containing '/*' as a part of the string value. This appears to trigger a comment-like behavior, disrupting proper syntax highlighting."
