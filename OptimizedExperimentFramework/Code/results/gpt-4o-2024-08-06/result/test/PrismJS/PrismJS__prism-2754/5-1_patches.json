    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting in JSX components when using the spread operator to pass props. The first button in the example uses the spread operator `{...{onClick, disabled}}`, which causes the syntax highlighting to break, as seen in the first image. The second button, which explicitly lists the props, is highlighted correctly.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is likely related to how the Prism syntax highlighter is parsing the spread operator within JSX tags. The current pattern for recognizing JSX tags and attributes may not correctly handle the spread operator, leading to incorrect tokenization and thus broken highlighting.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-jsx.js` file. The relevant section of the code is where the spread operator is defined and handled within the JSX tag pattern. The current pattern may not be correctly identifying or processing the spread operator, leading to the issue.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the spread operator is correctly recognized and tokenized within JSX tags. This involves adjusting the regular expression pattern that handles JSX tags to better accommodate the spread operator.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-jsx.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('inside', 'attr-name', {\n\t'spread': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\{\\s*\\.\\.\\.\\s*[a-z_$][\\w$]*(?:\\.[a-z_$][\\w$]*)*\\s*\\}/,\n\t\tinside: {\n\t\t\t'punctuation': /\\.\\.\\.|[{}.]/,\n\t\t\t'attr-value': /\\w+/\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, Prism.languages.jsx.tag);\n=======\nPrism.languages.insertBefore('inside', 'attr-name', {\n\t'spread': {\n\t\tpattern: /\\{\\s*\\.\\.\\.\\s*(?:[a-z_$][\\w$]*|\\{[^}]*\\})\\s*\\}/,\n\t\tinside: {\n\t\t\t'punctuation': /\\.\\.\\.|[{}.]/,\n\t\t\t'attr-value': /\\w+/\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}, Prism.languages.jsx.tag);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `pattern` for the `spread` property is updated to handle both simple identifiers and nested objects within the spread operator. This change ensures that the spread operator is correctly recognized even when it contains nested objects, which is a common use case in JSX.\n- This adjustment should help the Prism syntax highlighter correctly tokenize and highlight JSX components using the spread operator, resolving the issue with broken syntax highlighting."
