        "explanation": "The issue is related to the handling of spread props in JSX syntax highlighting. The files 'components/prism-jsx.js' and 'components/prism-jsx.min.js' contain the logic for JSX syntax parsing and highlighting. The problem likely lies in the regular expressions or parsing logic that handle spread operators, causing incorrect syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect syntax highlighting in JSX components when using spread props. The first image shows broken syntax highlighting with spread props, while the second image shows correct highlighting without spread props."
