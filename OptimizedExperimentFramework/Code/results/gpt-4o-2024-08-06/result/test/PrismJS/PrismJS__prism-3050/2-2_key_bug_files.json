        "explanation": "1. **components/prism-markup.js**: This file contains the language definitions for markup languages. To add support for Mermaid, modifications are likely needed here to define the syntax highlighting rules for Mermaid diagrams.\n\n2. **components/prism-core.js**: This file is central to the Prism library, handling the core functionality of syntax highlighting. Adding a new language like Mermaid would require updates to this file to ensure the language is recognized and processed correctly.\n\n3. **components.js**: This file lists all available languages and their configurations. To add Mermaid support, it would be necessary to include Mermaid in this list, specifying its dependencies and any special configurations needed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report requests adding language support for Mermaid, a language for creating diagrams using text and code. The provided example is a flowchart that can be rendered into a diagram."
