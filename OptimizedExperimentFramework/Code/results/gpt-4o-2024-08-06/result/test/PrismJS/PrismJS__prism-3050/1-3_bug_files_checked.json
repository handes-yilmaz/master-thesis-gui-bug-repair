        "explanation": "These files are likely responsible for parsing and rendering content in various languages. Adding support for Mermaid involves extending the syntax highlighting capabilities to recognize and correctly format Mermaid syntax. The identified files contain the code related to language components, and modifications to them would be necessary to integrate Mermaid.",

        "explanation": "To support a new language like Mermaid, modifications are typically made in the core components where language grammars are defined and parsed.\\n1. **components/prism-core.js**: Likely needs to be updated to include the syntax highlighting rules for Mermaid, allowing the proper parsing of the language.\\n2. **components.js**: This file may require updates to register the new Mermaid language within the list of supported languages.\\n3. **prism.js**: As a central file in the library, it could require changes to integrate Mermaid support, ensuring it's included in the overall syntax handling flow.",
        "bug_scenario": "The task is to add language support for Mermaid, a tool for diagram generation from textual descriptions, into the codebase. This involves ensuring the syntax and rendering of Mermaid diagrams are correctly interpreted and displayed by the system."
