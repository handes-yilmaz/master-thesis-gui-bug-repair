        "explanation": "The classes and functions identified are related to the handling and integration of new languages into the system. In 'components/prism-markup.js', the 'addInlined' function is responsible for adding support for inlined languages within markup, which is relevant for embedding Mermaid syntax within HTML tags. The 'addAttribute' function is used to highlight languages embedded in HTML attributes, which may be necessary for correctly rendering Mermaid code blocks. These elements are crucial for implementing Mermaid language support in the system, enabling the conversion of Mermaid syntax into visual diagrams.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves adding support for the Mermaid language in a system that renders diagrams from text and code. The Mermaid language allows users to create diagrams such as flowcharts using a text-based syntax, which can be rendered into a visual diagram."

            "components/prism-markup.js//addAttribute"
        ],
        "explanation": "The 'Prism.languages.markup' class in 'components/prism-markup.js' handles markup language definitions, which likely need to be extended to support Mermaid syntax. The 'addInlined' and 'addAttribute' functions are responsible for adding inlined languages and attributes, respectively, and may need to be modified to recognize and correctly process Mermaid syntax. The 'components.js' specifies available languages and their configurations; adding Mermaid to this configuration is necessary for its support.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report requests adding language support for Mermaid, a text-based tool for creating diagrams, to the existing syntax highlighting framework. The provided example shows a simple flowchart diagram written in Mermaid syntax, which can be rendered into a visual diagram as shown in the image."
