    "1/1": "To address the issue of adding language support for Mermaid in the provided code snippets, we need to make modifications to the `components/prism-markup.js` file. The goal is to ensure that Mermaid diagrams can be correctly highlighted and rendered.\n\n### Bug Scenario Image Description and Reasoning\n\nThe flowchart image provided in the bug report is a visual representation of a Mermaid diagram. The diagram uses Mermaid syntax to define a flowchart with nodes and connections. The issue is that the current code does not support Mermaid syntax highlighting, which is necessary for rendering such diagrams.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nTo add support for Mermaid, we need to define a new language within the Prism library that can recognize and highlight Mermaid syntax. This involves adding a new language definition and ensuring it is integrated with the existing markup handling.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-markup.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nPrism.languages.html = Prism.languages.markup;\nPrism.languages.mathml = Prism.languages.markup;\nPrism.languages.svg = Prism.languages.markup;\n=======\nPrism.languages.mermaid = {\n    'comment': /%%[^\\n]*/,\n    'keyword': /\\b(?:graph|subgraph|end|classDef|style|linkStyle|click|hover|interpolate)\\b/,\n    'arrow': /-->|---|==>/,\n    'string': {\n        pattern: /\"[^\"]*\"|'[^']*'/,\n        greedy: true\n    },\n    'punctuation': /[{}[\\];(),.:]/,\n    'operator': /--|==/\n};\n\nPrism.languages.html = Prism.languages.markup;\nPrism.languages.mathml = Prism.languages.markup;\nPrism.languages.svg = Prism.languages.markup;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Mermaid Language Definition**: We added a new language definition for Mermaid. This includes patterns for comments, keywords, arrows, strings, punctuation, and operators specific to Mermaid syntax.\n- **Integration**: The new language is integrated into the existing Prism setup, allowing it to be used alongside other languages like HTML, MathML, and SVG.\n\nThis patch will enable the Prism library to recognize and highlight Mermaid syntax, facilitating the rendering of diagrams as described in the bug report."
