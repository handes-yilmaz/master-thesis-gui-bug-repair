        "explanation": "The file `prism-java.js` is responsible for Java syntax highlighting, which directly relates to the 'UUID' highlighting issue. `prism-core.js` contains the core definitions for Prism's language syntaxes and tokenizations, which the Java component may rely on. `prism-clike.js` is often a base file for C-like languages, including Java, and it might have shared logic affecting class name tokenization.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is causing the Java code syntax highlighter to render the 'UUID' class incorrectly as plain text instead of as a 'class-name' token. This affects the visual representation of the code in the editor."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to Java syntax highlighting, which is managed by 'prism-java.js' within the 'components' directory. This file likely contains the language definitions for Java, including classes like 'UUID'. Additionally, 'prism-core.js' is integral to the overall functionality of Prism.js as it contains the core logic for syntax highlighting, and could also play a role in how classes are identified and highlighted.",
        "bug_scenario": "The 'UUID' keyword in Java code is highlighted incorrectly as plain text instead of being highlighted as a 'class-name'. This issue occurs within the Prism.js library used for syntax highlighting on the HackerTalk website."
