    "1/1": "To address the issue where \"UUID\" is not being highlighted correctly as a \"class-name\" token in Java code, we need to adjust the regular expression pattern for class names in the Prism Java language definition. Let's analyze the provided code snippet and make the necessary changes.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario**: The image shows that \"UUID\" is not highlighted as a class name. This is likely due to the regular expression pattern not matching class names that consist entirely of uppercase letters.\n\n2. **Root Cause**: The current pattern for class names in the Prism Java language definition does not account for class names that are entirely uppercase, such as \"UUID\".\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nWe need to modify the regular expression pattern for class names to include names that are entirely uppercase. Let's update the pattern in the `components/prism-java.js` file.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-java.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nvar className = {\n    pattern: RegExp(classNamePrefix + /[A-Z](?:[\\d_A-Z]*[a-z]\\w*)?\\b/.source),\n    lookbehind: true,\n    inside: {\n        'namespace': {\n            pattern: /^[a-z]\\w*(?:\\s*\\.\\s*[a-z]\\w*)*(?:\\s*\\.)?/,\n            inside: {\n                'punctuation': /\\./\n            }\n        },\n        'punctuation': /\\./\n    }\n};\n=======\nvar className = {\n    pattern: RegExp(classNamePrefix + /[A-Z](?:[\\d_A-Z]*[a-z]\\w*)?\\b|[A-Z]+\\b/.source),\n    lookbehind: true,\n    inside: {\n        'namespace': {\n            pattern: /^[a-z]\\w*(?:\\s*\\.\\s*[a-z]\\w*)*(?:\\s*\\.)?/,\n            inside: {\n                'punctuation': /\\./\n            }\n        },\n        'punctuation': /\\./\n    }\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Pattern**: The original pattern only matched class names that started with an uppercase letter followed by any combination of digits, underscores, uppercase letters, and at least one lowercase letter.\n  \n- **Updated Pattern**: The updated pattern includes an additional option to match class names that are entirely uppercase (`[A-Z]+\\b`). This ensures that class names like \"UUID\" are correctly identified as class names."
