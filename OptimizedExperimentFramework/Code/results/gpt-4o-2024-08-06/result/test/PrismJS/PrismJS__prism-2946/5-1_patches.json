    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is with the rendering of reStructuredText (reST) links and verbatim elements. In the provided images, the link and verbatim elements are not being detected correctly, causing the entire text to be rendered in italics instead of highlighting the link and verbatim elements separately. When the text is split into two lines, it renders correctly, indicating a problem with the pattern matching for inline elements.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe problem likely lies in the `components/prism-rest.js` file, specifically in the section handling inline elements. The pattern for matching inline elements might not be correctly identifying the boundaries of links and verbatim elements when they are on the same line.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the regex pattern for inline elements to correctly handle links and verbatim elements on the same line.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-rest.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[\\\\s\\\\-:\\\\/\\'\"<(\\\\[{])(?::[^:]+:`.*?`|`.*?`:[^:]+:|(\\\\*\\\\*?|``?|\\\\|)(?!\\\\s).*?\\\\S\\\\2(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$))/m,\n=======\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[\\\\s\\\\-:\\\\/\\'\"<(\\\\[{])(?::[^:]+:`.*?`|`[^`]+`_?|`.*?`:[^:]+:|(\\\\*\\\\*?|``?|\\\\|)(?!\\\\s).*?\\\\S\\\\2(?=[\\\\s\\\\-.,:;!?\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\'\")\\\\]}]|$))/m,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change modifies the regex pattern to correctly identify and separate links and verbatim elements, ensuring they are highlighted properly even when on the same line."
