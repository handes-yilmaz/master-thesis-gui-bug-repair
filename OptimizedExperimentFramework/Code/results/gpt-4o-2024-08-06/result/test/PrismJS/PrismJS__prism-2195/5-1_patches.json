    "1/1": "To address the issue of comments not highlighting correctly with line continuation in Visual Basic, we need to modify the regular expression pattern for comments in the `prism-visual-basic.js` file. The current pattern does not account for line continuations, which is why comments are not being highlighted properly when they span multiple lines.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe issue arises because the comment pattern does not handle line continuations (using `_` at the end of a line) correctly. This causes the comment to be treated as separate tokens rather than a single comment block.\n\n### Solution\nWe need to update the comment pattern to include line continuations. This involves modifying the regular expression to recognize the underscore (`_`) followed by a newline as part of the comment.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-visual-basic.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t'comment': {\n\\t\\tpattern: /(?:[\\'\u2018\u2019]|REM\\\\b).*/i,\n\\t\\tinside: {\n\\t\\t\\t'keyword': /^REM/i\n\\t\\t}\n\\t},\n=======\n\\t'comment': {\n\\t\\tpattern: /(?:[\\'\u2018\u2019]|REM\\\\b)(?:[^\\\\S\\\\r\\\\n]_[^\\\\S\\\\r\\\\n]*(?:\\\\r\\\\n?|\\\\n)|.)*/i,\n\\t\\tinside: {\n\\t\\t\\t'keyword': /^REM/i\n\\t\\t}\n\\t},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The updated pattern for comments now includes `(?:[^\\\\S\\\\r\\\\n]_[^\\\\S\\\\r\\\\n]*(?:\\\\r\\\\n?|\\\\n)|.)*`, which allows the comment to continue across lines if an underscore is used at the end of a line.\n- This change ensures that comments with line continuations are treated as a single token, allowing them to be highlighted correctly."
