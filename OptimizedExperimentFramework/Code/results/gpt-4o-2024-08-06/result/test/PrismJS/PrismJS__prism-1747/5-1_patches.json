    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is related to the incorrect handling of empty strings in Smalltalk syntax highlighting. In the provided example, the empty string `''` is not being recognized correctly, leading to incorrect syntax highlighting. The first image shows the incorrect highlighting where the empty string is not recognized, while the second image shows the correct highlighting where the empty string is handled properly.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe bug is likely in the `string` pattern definition within the Smalltalk language configuration in the `prism-smalltalk.js` and `prism-smalltalk.min.js` files. The current regex pattern for strings does not account for empty strings.\n\n### Patches for Bug Files\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the regex pattern for strings to include empty strings.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-smalltalk.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': /'(?:''|[^'])+'/,\n=======\n'string': /'(?:''|[^'])*'/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-smalltalk.min.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nstring:/\\'(?:\\'\\'|[^\\'])+\\'/,\n=======\nstring:/\\'(?:\\'\\'|[^\\'])*\\'/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes adjust the regex to correctly match empty strings by allowing zero or more characters between the single quotes."
