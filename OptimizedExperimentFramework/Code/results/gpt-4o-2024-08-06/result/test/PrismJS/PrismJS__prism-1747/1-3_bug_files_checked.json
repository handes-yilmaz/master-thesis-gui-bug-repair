        "explanation": "The file 'components/prism-smalltalk.js' is responsible for syntax highlighting rules for Smalltalk, so it is likely not correctly handling empty strings. The 'prism.js' file may also be involved if there are bugs in the core rendering logic affecting multiple languages.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that the syntax highlighting for Smalltalk empty strings is not handled correctly by Prism.js. In the image from 'prismjs.com', empty strings and adjacent text are not colored correctly, while in 'rouge.jneen.net', the text is colored as expected."

            "components/prism-smalltalk.min.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The files related to the Smalltalk language should handle syntax highlighting correctly. Since the problem is specifically related to the detection or processing of empty strings in Smalltalk, fixing this issue would require changes to how the Smalltalk syntax is parsed or highlighted in the 'prism-smalltalk.js' files within the 'components' directory.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the handling of empty strings in Smalltalk language highlighting. The incorrect output shows that the empty string is not treated correctly by Prism.js, resulting in incorrect coloring (an incorrectly green-colored part in the code snippet)."
