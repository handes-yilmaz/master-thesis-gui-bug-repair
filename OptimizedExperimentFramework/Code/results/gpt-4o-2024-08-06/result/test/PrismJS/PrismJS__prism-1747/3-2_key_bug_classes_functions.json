        "explanation": "The issue is related to the syntax highlighting of Smalltalk in Prism. The classes defined in both 'components/prism-smalltalk.js' and its minified version 'components/prism-smalltalk.min.js' likely contain the logic for handling strings, including empty strings. The incorrect handling of empty strings is likely due to a missing or incorrect regex pattern in these classes that fails to accommodate empty strings properly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the incorrect handling of empty strings in Smalltalk syntax highlighting. Specifically, the highlighting does not render empty strings as expected. This can be seen in the first image where the string should be highlighted green but is not, whereas the second image shows the correct highlighting where the string is green."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the syntax highlighting of Smalltalk code, specifically the handling of empty strings. The file 'components/prism-smalltalk.js' contains the language definitions for Smalltalk in Prism, which is responsible for highlighting the syntax. The 'string' pattern in this file likely does not account for empty strings correctly, causing incorrect highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting of empty strings in Smalltalk. The example provided shows that the string should be green, but it is not. The incorrect highlighting is visible on one platform but correct on another."
