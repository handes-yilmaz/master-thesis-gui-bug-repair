    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue with TypeScript syntax highlighting where certain keywords like `infer` and `type` are incorrectly highlighted as keywords even when they are part of an identifier (e.g., `inference`, `typeDefs`). The expected behavior is that these should only be highlighted as keywords when they stand alone.\n\nThe root cause of the issue is in the regular expression used to identify keywords in the TypeScript language definition. The current regex does not properly exclude cases where these keywords are followed by alphabetic characters, leading to incorrect highlighting.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue is located in the `components/prism-typescript.js` file, specifically in the regular expression used to define TypeScript keywords. The regex needs to be adjusted to ensure that keywords like `infer` and `type` are only highlighted when they are standalone and not part of a larger identifier.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-typescript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t/\\\\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)(?!\\\\s*[^\\\\s_${}*a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])/\n=======\n\\t\\t/\\\\b(?:asserts|infer|interface|module|namespace|type)\\\\b(?!\\\\s*[_$a-zA-Z\\\\xA0-\\\\uFFFF])/\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the regular expression to ensure that `infer` and `type` are only recognized as keywords when they are standalone, by using `\\\\b` to assert a word boundary after the keyword."
