    "1/1": "**Bug Scenario and Root Cause**\n\nThe image and bug report describe an issue with Markdown parsing where italic and bold text are too greedily matched. The problem arises when using `*` and `_` for italic and bold text, causing them to match any number of leading and trailing symbols, leading to incorrect parsing.\n\n**Bug Location and Analysis**\n\nThe issue is in the `italic` and `bold` patterns within the `components/prism-markdown.js` file. The current regex patterns are too permissive, allowing multiple leading and trailing symbols to be matched.\n\n**Patch to Fix the Bug**\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust the regex patterns for `italic` and `bold` to ensure they only match the correct number of leading and trailing symbols.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^\\\\\\\\])([*_])(?:(?:\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)(?!\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)|.)+?\\\\2/,\n=======\n\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^\\\\\\\\])([*_])((?:(?:\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)(?!\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)|.)+?)\\\\2/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^\\\\\\\\])(\\\\*\\\\*|__)(?:(?:\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)(?!\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)|.)+?\\\\2/,\n=======\n\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^\\\\\\\\])(\\\\*\\\\*|__)((?:(?:\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)(?!\\\\r?\\\\n|\\\\r)|.)+?)\\\\2/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThese changes ensure that the patterns for italic and bold text only match the correct number of leading and trailing symbols, preventing the greedy matching issue."
