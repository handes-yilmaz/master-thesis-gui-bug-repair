    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is related to the syntax highlighting of strings in VB.NET when an '@' symbol is included within the quotes. The first line in the image does not work because the '@' symbol is not recognized correctly within the string pattern, causing the syntax highlighting to break. The second line works because it does not contain the '@' symbol.\n\nThe root cause is the regular expression pattern used for matching strings in the `prism-basic.js` file. The pattern does not account for the '@' symbol, which is causing the issue.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-basic.js` file, specifically in the regular expression pattern for strings. We need to modify this pattern to include the '@' symbol.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-basic.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': {\n        pattern: /\"(?:\"\"|[!#$%&'()*,\\/:;<=>?^_ +\\-.A-Z\\d])*\"/i,\n        greedy: true\n    },\n=======\n'string': {\n        pattern: /\"(?:\"\"|[@!#$%&'()*,\\/:;<=>?^_ +\\-.A-Z\\d])*\"/i,\n        greedy: true\n    },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds the '@' symbol to the regular expression pattern, allowing it to be correctly recognized within strings, thus fixing the syntax highlighting issue."
