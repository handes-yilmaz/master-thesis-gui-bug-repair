        "explanation": "The issue relates to JavaScript syntax highlighting, indicating that files responsible for parsing and tokenizing JavaScript code, such as 'prism-javascript.js', are relevant. Furthermore, 'prism-clike.js' is often a dependency for JavaScript highlighting as it contains shared functionality for C-like languages. These files need to be updated to recognize underscore separators in numeric literals.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to JavaScript numeric separators not being highlighted correctly by Prism. Numeric literals such as 1_000_000 are not rendered as intended. The screenshot also shows various examples of numeric separators in different numeric systems (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, etc.), which are intended to improve readability but currently aren't properly supported."

            "components/prism-javascript.min.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to JavaScript numeric literals with numeric separators not being highlighted correctly in the Prism.js library. Therefore, the most relevant files are those handling JavaScript syntax highlighting, specifically `prism-javascript.js` and its minified version `prism-javascript.min.js`. These files likely contain the logic for identifying and styling numeric literals in JavaScript code.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the incorrect highlighting of JavaScript numeric literals that use numeric separators for readability (e.g., 1_000_000). The issue arises when numeric literals are not highlighted correctly when numeric separators are included. This affects developers who use numeric separators in their code, causing a visual discrepancy in Prism, a syntax highlighter for code."
