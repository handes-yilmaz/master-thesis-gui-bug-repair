        "explanation": "The issue is related to the incorrect highlighting of JavaScript numeric literals when numeric separators are used. The 'Prism.languages.javascript' object in 'components/prism-javascript.js' defines the patterns for syntax highlighting. The 'number' pattern in this object needs to be updated to accommodate numeric separators (underscores) to ensure correct highlighting of these literals.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves JavaScript numeric literals using underscores as separators being highlighted incorrectly. The screenshot shows that numeric literals such as '1_000_000_000_000' and '1_019_436_871.42' are not highlighted properly in Prism. Numeric separators should allow for more readable grouping of digits in literals."

        "explanation": "The issue lies in the incorrect handling of numeric literals with separators in the JavaScript syntax highlighting rules. The 'number' pattern in 'Prism.languages.javascript' in 'components/prism-javascript.js' does not account for numeric separators. Adjusting this pattern to handle underscores in numeric literals will fix the highlighting issue. No specific functions are directly involved, as the pattern definition is part of the language configuration.",

Numeric literals such as '1_000_000_000_000' and '1_019_436_871.42' are not highlighted correctly, which is contrary to the expected behavior where numeric separators should be supported for improved readability."
