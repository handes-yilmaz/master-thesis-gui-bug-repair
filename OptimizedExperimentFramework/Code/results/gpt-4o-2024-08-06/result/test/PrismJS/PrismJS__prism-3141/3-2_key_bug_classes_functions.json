        "explanation": "The issue is related to the SQL tick marks not being recognized as part of a string pattern in the syntax highlighting. The `Prism.languages.sql` object in `components/prism-sql.js` contains the definition for SQL language syntax highlighting. The pattern for strings needs to be updated to include tick marks (`) in addition to the existing patterns for double quotes (\") and single quotes ('). This is why the `Prism.languages.sql` object is the bug-related element.",
