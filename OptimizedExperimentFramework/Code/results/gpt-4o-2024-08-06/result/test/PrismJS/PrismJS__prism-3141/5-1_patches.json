    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue with SQL syntax highlighting where tick marks (`` ` ``) used to surround keywords are not being highlighted as strings. The provided image shows SQL code with tick marks around table and column names, which should be highlighted as strings but are not.\n\nThe root cause is that the current regex pattern for strings in the `Prism.languages.sql` configuration does not account for tick marks. The pattern only considers double and single quotes.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the `components/prism-sql.js` file, the `string` pattern is defined as:\n\n```javascript\n'string': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^@\\\\])(\"|')(?:\\\\[\\s\\S]|(?!\\2)[^\\\\]|\\2\\2)*\\2/,\n    greedy: true,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n```\n\nThis pattern needs to be updated to include tick marks as valid string delimiters.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `string` pattern to include tick marks. Here is the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-sql.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^@\\\\])(\"|')(?:\\\\[\\s\\S]|(?!\\2)[^\\\\]|\\2\\2)*\\2/,\n    greedy: true,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n=======\n'string': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^@\\\\])(\"|'|`)(?:\\\\[\\s\\S]|(?!\\2)[^\\\\]|\\2\\2)*\\2/,\n    greedy: true,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change updates the regex pattern to recognize tick marks as valid string delimiters, ensuring that keywords surrounded by tick marks are highlighted correctly."
