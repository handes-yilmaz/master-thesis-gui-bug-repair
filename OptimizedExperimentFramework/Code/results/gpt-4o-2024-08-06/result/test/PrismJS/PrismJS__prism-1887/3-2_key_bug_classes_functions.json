        "explanation": "The issue lies in the syntax highlighting rules for C++ numbers within the 'prism-cpp.js' file. The regular expression defining number patterns does not correctly handle single quotes as separators within numeric literals. The attempt to modify the regex in 'prism-c.js' to include single quotes in number patterns suggests that the bug originates from how these patterns are defined and parsed in the 'prism-cpp.js' file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting for C++ literals that use single quotes as separators. The left side of the images shows the current, incorrect highlighting, while the right side shows the correct highlighting. The issue is particularly noticeable with numbers containing multiple quotes, where the quotes are not being recognized correctly in the syntax highlighting."

        "explanation": "The issue lies in the syntax highlighting rules for C++ numbers in the 'components/prism-cpp.js' file. This file contains the logic for extending C language syntax to C++ and is responsible for parsing numbers correctly. The regex pattern used needs to be updated to handle single quotes in numeric literals, as demonstrated by the attempted solution in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect syntax highlighting for C++ numeric literals with single quotes separating digits. The images show that the current highlighting does not recognize these quotes correctly in both integer and floating-point literals, leading to inconsistent and incorrect syntax coloring."
