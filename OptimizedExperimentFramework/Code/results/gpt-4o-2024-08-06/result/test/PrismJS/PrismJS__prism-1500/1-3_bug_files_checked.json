        "explanation": "The issue is likely related to the way SQL comments are parsed and highlighted in the prism library. The file 'components/prism-sql.js' is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for SQL, and likely contains the logic used to identify comments. Therefore, it would need examination and potential modification to properly handle comments. The file 'prism.js' is the core library file where the overall functionality, including loading and combining different language syntaxes, is implemented. Hence, it might also need updates to ensure proper integration and application of fixed comment highlighting rules across SQL parsing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The SQL comment in the given SQL code is not being highlighted correctly. As shown in the image, the SQL code is displayed with syntax highlighting, but the comment following the '--' is not correctly highlighted, leading to inappropriate emphasis and confusion in reading the SQL script."

            "prism.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is with SQL syntax highlighting, which is likely defined in the `prism-sql.js` and `prism-sql.min.js` files as they contain the rules and definitions for SQL highlighting. The main `prism.js` file is also potentially involved as it integrates the different language definitions and might have overarching logic affecting the comment parsing. These files need to be checked for proper handling of SQL comments to ensure they are highlighted correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The SQL highlighting feature incorrectly processes comments. The expected behavior is that SQL comments should be highlighted correctly, without affecting the rest of the code. However, in the given scenario, there seems to be an issue with incorrect color-coding or highlighting of the SQL comment, which might cause confusion or misinterpretation of the SQL script in applications using this highlighter."
