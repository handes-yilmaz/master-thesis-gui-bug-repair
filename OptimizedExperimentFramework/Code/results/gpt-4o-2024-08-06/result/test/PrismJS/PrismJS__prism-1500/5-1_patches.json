    "1/1": "To address the issue of incorrect SQL comment highlighting, we need to adjust the regular expression pattern used for detecting comments in the Prism.js SQL language definition. The current pattern might not be correctly identifying comments, especially when they are followed by certain characters or whitespace.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image shows that the SQL comment is not being highlighted correctly. The comment line `-- this is a comment` should be highlighted as a comment, but it seems to be misinterpreted by the syntax highlighter.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause is likely the regular expression pattern used to detect comments in the SQL language definition. The pattern might not be correctly handling the comment syntax, especially when it comes to line breaks or specific characters following the comment.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nWe need to adjust the regular expression pattern for comments in the `components/prism-sql.js` and `components/prism-sql.min.js` files to ensure that comments are correctly identified and highlighted.\n\n### Patches\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-sql.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n=======\n'comment': {\n    pattern: /(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#)[^\\r\\n]*)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-sql.min.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncomment:{pattern:/(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#).*)/,lookbehind:!0},\n=======\ncomment:{pattern:/(^|[^\\\\])(?:\\/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*\\/|(?:--|\\/\\/|#)[^\\r\\n]*)/,lookbehind:!0},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The regular expression pattern for comments has been updated to ensure that it correctly matches comments that start with `--`, `//`, or `#` and continue until the end of the line.\n- The change involves modifying the pattern to `[^\\r\\n]*` to match any characters except for line breaks, ensuring that the comment is correctly highlighted up to the end of the line."
