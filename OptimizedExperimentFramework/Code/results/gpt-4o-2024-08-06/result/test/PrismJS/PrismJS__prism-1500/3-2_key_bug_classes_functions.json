        "explanation": "The bug is related to the incorrect handling of SQL comments in syntax highlighting. The class 'Prism.languages.sql' in 'components/prism-sql.js' specifically deals with defining the patterns for SQL syntax elements, including comments. The incorrect or incomplete pattern matching for comments is likely the cause of the highlighting issue, so this class is directly related to the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The SQL comment in the provided code snippet is not being properly highlighted. In the image, the comment '-- this is a comment' should appear in a different color to distinguish it as a comment, but it does not, indicating an issue with the syntax highlighting for comments in SQL."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of SQL comments in Prism.js. The 'components/prism-sql.js' and 'components/prism-sql.min.js' files contain the language definitions for SQL, including patterns for comments. The pattern for comments in these files likely contains an error or oversight that causes incorrect highlighting, particularly after comments in SQL code. Adjusting the comment pattern will address the issue, ensuring comments do not interfere with the rest of the code highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows SQL code with incorrect syntax highlighting after a comment. The comment line is not highlighted distinctly, and the subsequent SQL code appears to be misinterpreted, affecting the highlighting of the entire code block."
