    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting for single-package names in Java code. The image shows that the `package` keyword is highlighted, but the package name `baz` is not. This issue arises because the current syntax highlighting rules do not account for single-package names, only for multi-part package names.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe bug is located in the `components/prism-java.js` file. The relevant section is where the `namespace` pattern is defined. This pattern currently only matches multi-part package names (e.g., `foo.bar`), but not single-part names like `baz`.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `namespace` pattern to also match single-package names. Here's the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-java.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(\\\\b(?:exports|import(?:\\\\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\\\\s+)[a-z]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.[a-z]\\\\w*)+/,\n=======\n\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(\\\\b(?:exports|import(?:\\\\s+static)?|module|open|opens|package|provides|requires|to|transitive|uses|with)\\\\s+)[a-z]\\\\w*(?:\\\\.[a-z]\\\\w*)*/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change allows the `namespace` pattern to match both single and multi-part package names, ensuring correct syntax highlighting for all valid Java package declarations."
