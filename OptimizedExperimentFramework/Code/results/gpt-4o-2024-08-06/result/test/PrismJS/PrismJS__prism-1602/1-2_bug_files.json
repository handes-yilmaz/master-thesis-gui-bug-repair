        "explanation": "The `prism-yaml.js` file is likely where the YAML language definition and highlighting rules are implemented. Errors in this file could lead to incorrect syntax highlighting for YAML code. The `prism.js` file is the main library file where overall language processing might be handled, contributing to how comments and strings are parsed together.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to YAML string highlighting not working correctly when there is a trailing comment on the same line as the string. In the provided image, the word 'world' is not highlighted properly when followed by the comment '# test', indicating that the Prism.js highlighting library does not handle this scenario as expected."

        "explanation": "The issue is specifically related to YAML syntax highlighting, so the primary file of concern is 'components/prism-yaml.js'. This file likely contains the logic for parsing and highlighting YAML syntax. Additionally, 'prism.js' is the main library file that incorporates all language components, including YAML, and might also require modifications to ensure consistent behavior or integration.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when YAML string highlighting fails if there is a comment on the same line as the string. In the provided example, the string 'world' is not highlighted correctly when followed by ' # test'."
