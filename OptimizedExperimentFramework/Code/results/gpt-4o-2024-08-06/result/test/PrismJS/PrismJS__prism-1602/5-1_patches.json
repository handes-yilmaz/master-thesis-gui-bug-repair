    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue with YAML string highlighting when a string has a comment on the same line. In the provided example, the string `\"world\"` followed by a comment `# test` is not highlighted correctly. The image shows that the string is not colored as expected, indicating a failure in the syntax highlighting.\n\nThe root cause is likely in the regex pattern used to identify strings in the YAML syntax. The current pattern may not account for comments following strings on the same line, causing the highlighting to fail.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in `components/prism-yaml.js`. The `string` pattern is defined as:\n\n```javascript\n'string': {\n    pattern: /([:\\-,[{]\\s*(?:![^\\s]+)?[ \\t]*)(\"|\\')(?:(?!\\2)[^\\\\\\r\\n]|\\\\.)*\\2(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}))/m,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n},\n```\n\nThis pattern does not consider comments that may follow a string on the same line. The lookahead assertion `(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}))` needs to be adjusted to allow for comments.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the regex pattern for `string` to account for comments after strings.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-yaml.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'string': {\n    pattern: /([:\\-,[{]\\s*(?:![^\\s]+)?[ \\t]*)(\"|\\')(?:(?!\\2)[^\\\\\\r\\n]|\\\\.)*\\2(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}))/m,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n},\n=======\n'string': {\n    pattern: /([:\\-,[{]\\s*(?:![^\\s]+)?[ \\t]*)(\"|\\')(?:(?!\\2)[^\\\\\\r\\n]|\\\\.)*\\2(?=[ \\t]*(?:$|,|]|}|#))/m,\n    lookbehind: true,\n    greedy: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change allows the regex to recognize strings even if they are followed by a comment, ensuring proper syntax highlighting."
