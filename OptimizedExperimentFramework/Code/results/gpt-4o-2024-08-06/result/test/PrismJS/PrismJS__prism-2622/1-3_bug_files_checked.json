        "explanation": "The file 'components/prism-java.js' is directly related because the Apex language definition is supposed to alias the Java language. To implement this aliasing correctly, Prism's configuration for Java (located in 'prism-java.js') will be reused for Apex. Thus, understanding and possibly modifying the Java definition could be necessary to ensure that the alias behaves as expected.",
        "bug_scenario": "The task involves adding support for the Apex programming language by effectively aliasing the Java language definition using the Prism library. The provided code snippet demonstrates how Apex would be defined as an alias of Java using Prism. This approach minimizes redundancy by leveraging the similarity between Java and Apex rather than creating a fully separate definition."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug report indicates the need for support for the Apex language in a syntax highlighting library. The code snippet suggests using Java's existing definition for Apex, which can be added to the repository as a new language alias. To implement this, modifications would likely be required in the following files:\n\n1. **components/prism-java.js** and **components/prism-java.min.js**: Since Apex is to be treated as an alias of Java, these files would need adjustments to ensure that the Java language definition supports being aliased as Apex.\n\n2. **components/index.js**: This file typically manages the inclusion of different language files, so it would need to be updated to correctly register and alias Apex using the Java language definition.",
        "bug_scenario": "The scenario involves adding support for the Apex language using Prism.js, treating it as an alias of Java due to their syntactic similarities. The image shows sample Apex code that needs to be highlighted properly in the editor/website but currently might not be."
