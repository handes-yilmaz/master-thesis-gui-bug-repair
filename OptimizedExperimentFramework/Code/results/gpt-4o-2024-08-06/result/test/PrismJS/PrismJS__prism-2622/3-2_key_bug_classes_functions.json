        "explanation": "The function 'loadLanguages' in 'components/index.js' is responsible for loading language definitions into the application. To add support for Apex, modifications may be required in this function to properly recognize and handle Apex as either an alias of Java or as a distinct language, depending on the design decision. This function is key because it manages the dynamic loading of language components, which is central to integrating a new language.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves adding support for the Apex language, which is similar to Java, to a system that currently supports Java. The code snippet provided in the bug report shows a simple aliasing of the Java language to Apex, but there may be complications or inefficiencies in treating Apex as a completely new language definition."

        "explanation": "The bug relates to the lack of support for Apex language syntax highlighting in the codebase. The 'loadLanguages' function in 'components/index.js' is responsible for loading language definitions into the Prism instance. To support Apex, modifications are needed to ensure Apex is recognized and handled properly, possibly by aliasing it with existing Java language definitions or creating a new language definition if necessary. This function is key to dynamically loading languages and would need adjustments to include Apex.",
        "bug_scenario": "The scenario involves adding support for the Apex programming language, which is similar to Java, to a codebase that uses Prism for syntax highlighting. The image shows Apex code that needs proper syntax highlighting, which is not currently supported directly by Prism."
