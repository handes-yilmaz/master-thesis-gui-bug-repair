    "1/1": "To address the issue of adding support for Apex as an alias of Java in the Prism language definitions, we need to modify the code to ensure that Apex is recognized and handled correctly. Here's how we can do it:\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report suggests adding support for Apex by aliasing it to Java. The provided code snippet in the bug report shows how to alias Apex to Java using Prism:\n\n```javascript\n// prism-apex.js\n;(function (Prism) {\n  Prism.languages.apex = Prism.languages.java\n})(Prism)\n```\n\nThe root cause of the issue is that Apex is not currently recognized as a separate language in the system, and we need to ensure that it is loaded and treated as an alias of Java.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is from `components/index.js`, which handles the loading of languages. We need to ensure that when Apex is requested, it is correctly aliased to Java.\n\n### Patch\n\nWe will modify the `loadLanguages` function to handle Apex as an alias of Java. Here's the patch:\n\n```javascript\n### components/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\tif (!(lang in components.languages)) {\n\\t\\t\\tif (!loadLanguages.silent) {\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsole.warn('Language does not exist: ' + lang);\n\\t\\t\\t}\n\\t\\t\\treturn;\n\\t\\t}\n=======\n\\t\\tif (!(lang in components.languages)) {\n\\t\\t\\tif (lang === 'apex') {\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlang = 'java'; // Alias Apex to Java\n\\t\\t\\t} else {\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (!loadLanguages.silent) {\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tconsole.warn('Language does not exist: ' + lang);\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn;\n\\t\\t\\t}\n\\t\\t}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We check if the language is 'apex'. If it is, we alias it to 'java' by setting `lang = 'java'`.\n- This ensures that when Apex is requested, it loads the Java language definition instead, effectively treating Apex as an alias of Java."
