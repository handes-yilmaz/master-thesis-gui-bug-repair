        "explanation": "The issue is related to the pattern used for highlighting class names in the `Prism.languages.cpp` configuration. The pattern is not correctly identifying class names in contexts like inheritance or method definitions, leading to the highlighting issue. Adjusting the regex pattern for `class-name` would likely address the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves PrismJS failing to highlight C++ class names in the code. Specifically, class names like `QMainWindow` and method class references like `MainWindow::changeWindowTitle()` are not being highlighted, which is visible in the provided image."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The issue lies in the class name highlighting pattern within the 'Prism.languages.cpp' definition. The regex pattern responsible for detecting class names may not be correctly identifying all class names, particularly in scenarios with inheritance or scope resolution. Adjustments to this pattern can ensure proper highlighting for class names such as 'QMainWindow' and 'MainWindow'.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided image and description, PrismJS fails to highlight class names like 'MainWindow' and 'QMainWindow' in C++ code. The example shows a class definition and a method implementation where these names are not highlighted as expected."
