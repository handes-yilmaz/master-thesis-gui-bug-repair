    "1/1": "To address the issue with PrismJS not highlighting class names in C++ code, we need to modify the `prism-cpp.js` file. The problem is that the current pattern for class names does not account for class names in inheritance or method definitions.\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\n1. **Scenario**: The image shows C++ code where class names like `QMainWindow` and `MainWindow` are not highlighted by PrismJS.\n2. **Root Cause**: The regular expression for class names only matches class declarations but not class names in inheritance or method definitions.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nWe need to update the regular expression for class names to include these scenarios.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-cpp.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n'class-name': {\n    pattern: /(\\b(?:class|enum|struct)\\s+)(?!class|enum|struct)\\w+/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n=======\n'class-name': {\n    pattern: /(\\b(?:class|enum|struct)\\s+)(?!class|enum|struct)\\w+|\\b\\w+(?=\\s*::)/,\n    lookbehind: true\n},\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Pattern**: The original pattern only matches class names following `class`, `enum`, or `struct`.\n- **Updated Pattern**: The updated pattern includes `\\b\\w+(?=\\s*::)` to match class names in method definitions (e.g., `MainWindow::changeWindowTitle`).\n\nThis change should ensure that class names in both inheritance and method definitions are highlighted correctly."
