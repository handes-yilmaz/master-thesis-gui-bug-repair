        "explanation": "The files `prism-cpp.js` and `prism-clike.js` are potentially related to the bug because they are responsible for the syntax highlighting of C++ and languages similar to C. Adjustments or fixes to these files may address the issue where PrismJS fails to highlight C++ class names correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is that PrismJS does not correctly highlight class names in C++, such as `QMainWindow` and `MainWindow` in the provided code example. This lack of highlighting is evident in the code snippets where class names are not distinguished visually as expected."

            "components/prism-clike.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "PrismJS typically uses language-specific components to apply syntax highlighting rules. Since the problem is with C++ code highlighting, the main files that would relate to this issue are likely 'prism-cpp.js' for C++ language-specific logic and 'prism-clike.js' since C++ is part of the C-like family of languages which might share similar syntax highlighting rules. Updating these files would be necessary to address how class names are identified and highlighted.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to PrismJS not being able to highlight the class names in C++ code. In the given code snippet, class names like 'QMainWindow' and 'MainWindow' are not highlighted by PrismJS, though they should be. The issue is evident in the image, where class names are not visually distinguished as intended."
