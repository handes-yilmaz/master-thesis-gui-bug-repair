        "explanation": "The files `prism-shell-session.js` and `prism-shell-session.min.js` are responsible for tokenizing and highlighting the \"Shell session\" language in Prism.js. Changes in these files likely introduced the bug causing incorrect tokenization. This is consistent with the bug report describing a problem with highlighting the shell session commands.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the incorrect tokenization of the \"Shell session\" language in Prism.js. The issue persists across versions 1.22 and 1.23. The DOM tree shows that the expected tokenization is not applied correctly, leading to incorrect highlighting. Older versions of 1.22 worked correctly, suggesting recent changes might have caused the regression."

            "prism.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The problem specifically affects the \"Shell session\" language, so both the `prism-shell-session.js` and `prism-shell-session.min.js` files are relevant as they handle the tokenization logic for this language. Since the issue is related to the download version, `prism.js`, which is the core library file, might also have changes affecting the behavior.",
        "bug_scenario": "The syntax highlighting for the \"Shell session\" language appears to be broken in recent versions of the Prism library. The issue is seen in the web downloads where the syntax is not being tokenized correctly, as shown in the images where the expected tokenization is not happening."
