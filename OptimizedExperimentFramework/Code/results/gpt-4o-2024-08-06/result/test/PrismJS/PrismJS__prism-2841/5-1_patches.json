    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is that interpolation within regular expressions using the `/.../` syntax in Ruby is not being highlighted correctly. The image shows that while `%r{...}` correctly highlights the interpolation, `/.../` does not. This is due to the missing handling of interpolation within the `/.../` regex pattern in the Prism syntax highlighter for Ruby.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the `components/prism-ruby.js` file, the regex pattern for handling regular expressions does not account for interpolation when using the `/.../` syntax. The existing pattern for `%r{...}` includes interpolation handling, but the `/.../` pattern does not.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the regex pattern for `/.../` to include interpolation handling, similar to how it is done for `%r{...}`.\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-ruby.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^/])\\\\/(?!\\\\/)(?:\\\\[[^\\\\r\\\\n\\\\]]+\\\\]|\\\\\\\\.|[^[/\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\n])+\\\\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\\\\s*(?:$|[\\\\r\\\\n,.;})]))/,\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlookbehind: true,\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreedy: true\n=======\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpattern: /(^|[^/])\\\\/(?!\\\\/)(?:\\\\[[^\\\\r\\\\n\\\\]]+\\\\]|\\\\\\\\.|#\\\\{[^}]+\\\\}|[^[/\\\\\\\\\\\\r\\\\n])+\\\\/[gim]{0,3}(?=\\\\s*(?:$|[\\\\r\\\\n,.;})]))/,\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlookbehind: true,\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreedy: true,\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinside: {\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'interpolation': interpolation\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds interpolation handling to the `/.../` regex pattern, ensuring that interpolation within these regular expressions is highlighted correctly."
