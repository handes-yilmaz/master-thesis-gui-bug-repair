        "explanation": "These files are likely involved in handling syntax highlighting for Ruby within the Prism library. `prism-ruby.js` is responsible for Ruby syntax highlighting, while `prism-regex.js` could play a role in managing regex patterns across different languages. Modifications in these files can ensure that interpolation within regex is handled uniformly across all Ruby regex formats.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that interpolation within regular expressions like `/foo#{bar}/` is not being highlighted in Ruby. The image shows that when the regex is wrapped with `/.../`, interpolation is not highlighted, but when wrapped with `%r{...}`, it is highlighted correctly. This suggests a problem with syntax highlighting for regex in Ruby within the current codebase."

        "explanation": "The problem is specific to the Ruby language syntax highlighting for regex. `prism-ruby.js` likely contains the language definition for Ruby, including regex syntax, and needs to handle interpolation within `/.../`. The file `prism-regex.js`, if exists, might be related to regex processing and could require handling for interpolation as well.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is that interpolation within Ruby regex using `/.../` is not being highlighted correctly, whereas interpolation using `%r{...}` is highlighted correctly."
