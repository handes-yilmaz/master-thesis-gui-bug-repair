        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of Elixir code, specifically handling attributes ending in '?'. The file `components/prism-elixir.js` contains the relevant code for Elixir syntax highlighting, including the regular expressions that define how different tokens are identified. The issue is caused by a missing '?' in the regular expression for 'attr-name', which requires editing this file to fix the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image and bug report describe a scenario where attributes ending with '?' in Elixir are not correctly highlighted because the regular expression used in the syntax highlighting does not account for attributes with a trailing question mark. The solution is to modify the regular expression pattern to include the optional '?' at the end."

        ],
        "explanation": "The file `components/prism-elixir.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for the Elixir language in the PrismJS library. The bug report specifically identifies this file and a line within it (line 40, as per the URL provided) that contains the incorrect regex pattern which needs modification to correctly recognize attributes ending with '?'. Therefore, `components/prism-elixir.js` is the file that needs to be edited to fix the syntax highlighting issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting of Elixir attributes in the PrismJS library. The attributes ending with '?' are not recognized properly due to a missing '?' in the regex pattern responsible for tokenizing these attributes. This issue results in incorrect syntax highlighting for Elixir attributes ending with '?', as demonstrated in the screenshot where such an attribute is not highlighted correctly."
