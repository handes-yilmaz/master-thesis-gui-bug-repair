    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to modify the regex pattern for `attr-name` in the `prism-elixir.js` file to correctly identify attributes ending with a `?`. Here's how we can fix it:\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting for Elixir attributes that end with a `?`. The current regex pattern for `attr-name` does not account for the optional `?` at the end of attribute names, leading to incorrect tokenization.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe bug is located in the `prism-elixir.js` file, specifically in the regex pattern for `attr-name`. We need to update this pattern to include an optional `?` at the end of attribute names.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### components/prism-elixir.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n\t// Look-ahead prevents bad highlighting of the :: operator\n\t'attr-name': /\\w+:(?!:)/,\n=======\n\t// Look-ahead prevents bad highlighting of the :: operator\n\t'attr-name': /\\w+\\??:(?!:)/,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change will ensure that attributes ending with a `?` are correctly recognized and highlighted."
