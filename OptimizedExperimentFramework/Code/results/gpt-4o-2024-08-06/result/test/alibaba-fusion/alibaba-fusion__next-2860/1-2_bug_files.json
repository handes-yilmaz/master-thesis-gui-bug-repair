        "explanation": "The bug is related to the visibility and focus behavior of the NumberPicker component's buttons, which are likely implemented in 'src/number-picker/index.jsx' and 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx'. The styling aspect related to ':focus-within' might be handled in 'src/number-picker/style.js' to maintain the focus style.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the NumberPicker component where the focus does not correctly highlight the buttons when navigating with the keyboard. Once focused, the buttons should become visible and maintain focus style using ':focus-within'."

            "src/number-picker/scss/variable.scss"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are likely related to the bug as they contain the logic and styling for the NumberPicker component. The `index.jsx` and `number-picker.jsx` files probably handle the component's keyboard interactions and focus management, which are crucial to maintaining visibility of the buttons when the component is focused. The `style.js` and `variable.scss` files define the styles that need to be adjusted to ensure the `:focus-within` state is applied correctly. These files are likely involved in fixing the display and styling issues mentioned in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when the focus is moved to the NumberPicker component via the keyboard. The operation button should be visible when the NumberPicker is focused, but it is currently hidden. Additionally, when the focus moves to the operation button by pressing Tab again, the focus style of the NumberPicker disappears. The focus state should be maintained using `:focus-within`."
