    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the operation buttons in the `NumberPicker` component are visible when the component is focused. The problem is that the buttons remain hidden even when the focus is on the component, and the focus state disappears when tabbing to the buttons.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image and bug report indicate that when the `NumberPicker` is focused, the operation buttons (`+` and `-`) should be visible. However, they remain hidden, and the focus state is lost when tabbing to the buttons. This is likely due to the lack of a `:focus-within` style that would maintain the focus appearance when any child element of the `NumberPicker` is focused.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue can be fixed by ensuring that the `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class is applied to the `NumberPicker` component. This will maintain the focus state when any child element, such as the operation buttons, is focused.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue in the `src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx` file:\n\n```javascript\n### src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    render() {\n        const {\n            device,\n            prefix,\n            rtl,\n            disabled,\n            style,\n            className,\n            size,\n            max,\n            min,\n            autoFocus,\n=======\n    render() {\n        const {\n            device,\n            prefix,\n            rtl,\n            disabled,\n            style,\n            className,\n            size,\n            max,\n            min,\n            autoFocus,\n            alwaysShowTrigger,\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the `alwaysShowTrigger` property is considered, which can be used to control the visibility of the operation buttons. Additionally, you may need to add CSS to handle the `:focus-within` state to ensure the focus style is maintained when the component or its children are focused."
