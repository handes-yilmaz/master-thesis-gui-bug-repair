    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\n**Bug Scenario:**\n1. The user types \"r\" in the search input, triggering suggestions.\n2. Upon pressing Enter, the search term used is \"r\" instead of the selected suggestion \"Recent.\"\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe issue arises because the Enter key triggers a search with the current input value rather than the selected suggestion from the autocomplete list.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nIn the provided code snippet from `src/search/Search.jsx`, the `onKeyDown` method is responsible for handling the Enter key press. It directly calls `this.onSearch()` using the current input value without considering the selected suggestion.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe need to modify the `onKeyDown` method to check if a suggestion is selected and use that value for the search.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### src/search/Search.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    onKeyDown = e => {\n        if (this.props.disabled) {\n            return;\n        }\n        if (e.keyCode !== KEYCODE.ENTER) {\n            return;\n        }\n        this.onSearch();\n    };\n=======\n    onKeyDown = e => {\n        if (this.props.disabled) {\n            return;\n        }\n        if (e.keyCode !== KEYCODE.ENTER) {\n            return;\n        }\n        const selectedSuggestion = this.autoCompleteRef && this.autoCompleteRef.getSelectedValue();\n        const searchValue = selectedSuggestion || this.state.value;\n        this.props.onSearch(searchValue, this.state.filterValue);\n    };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification**: The `onKeyDown` method now checks if there is a selected suggestion using a reference to the `AutoComplete` component (`this.autoCompleteRef.getSelectedValue()`).\n- **Search Value**: It uses the selected suggestion if available; otherwise, it defaults to the current input value.\n- **Reference**: Ensure that `this.autoCompleteRef` is correctly set to the `AutoComplete` component in the `render` method.\n\nThis change ensures that the search uses the selected suggestion when the Enter key is pressed, resolving the inconsistency between the search term and the selected suggestion."
