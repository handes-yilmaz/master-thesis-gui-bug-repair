        "explanation": "The issue is related to the CascaderSelect component, as described in the bug report. The file 'components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx' contains the definition for the CascaderSelect component where the virtual scrolling logic and styling are likely managed. Since the problem is about the background color anomaly during scrolling, the component's implementation and styling need to be checked and possibly adjusted to correct the behavior.",
