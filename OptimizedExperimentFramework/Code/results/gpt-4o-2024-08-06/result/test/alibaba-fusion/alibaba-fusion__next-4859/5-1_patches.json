    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, let's analyze the provided information and code snippets.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates an issue with the background color when using virtual scrolling in the `CascaderSelect` component. The image shows a dropdown menu with a background color that seems inconsistent or incorrect.\n\nThe root cause is likely related to the CSS styles applied to the dropdown items when virtual scrolling is enabled. The styles might not be correctly set or overridden, leading to the visual inconsistency.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippets are in two files:\n\n1. **`components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx`**: This file contains the logic for the `CascaderSelect` component, but the issue seems to be more related to styling rather than logic.\n\n2. **`components/cascader-select/main.scss`**: This file contains the SCSS styles for the `CascaderSelect` component. The issue is likely here, specifically in the styles for the dropdown items.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nLet's focus on the SCSS file to ensure the background color is correctly set for dropdown items when virtual scrolling is used.\n\n```javascript\n### components/cascader-select/main.scss\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n.#{$css-prefix}menu-item:hover {\n    color: $color-text1-2;\n    /* TODO */\n    background: $color-white;\n    cursor: default;\n}\n=======\n.#{$css-prefix}menu-item:hover {\n    color: $color-text1-2;\n    background: $color-background-hover; // Use a variable for hover background\n    cursor: default;\n}\n\n.#{$css-prefix}menu-item {\n    background: $color-background-default; // Ensure default background is set\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Hover Background**: Changed the hover background color to use a variable (`$color-background-hover`) that should be defined in your SCSS variables file. This ensures consistency and allows easy updates.\n  \n- **Default Background**: Added a default background color (`$color-background-default`) to ensure that the menu items have a consistent background when not hovered.\n\nThese changes should address the visual inconsistency by ensuring that the background colors are correctly applied and consistent with the design specifications."
