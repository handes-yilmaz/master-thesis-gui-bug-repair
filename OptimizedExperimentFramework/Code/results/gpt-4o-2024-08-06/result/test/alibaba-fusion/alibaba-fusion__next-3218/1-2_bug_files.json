        "explanation": "The files within the 'select' component directory are relevant because they likely contain the styles and logic used in rendering the Select component demos. The CSS files such as 'mixin.scss' and 'variable.scss' potentially contain styling rules affecting layout margins and might include the hard-coded styles mentioned. The documentation files ('index.md') could also be related if they contain embedded styles or settings affecting demo display. Code adjustments might be necessary in these files to make the styling less rigid and more adaptable across different demo components.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that certain Select demo styles are too strict, affecting other demos. The screenshots exhibit discrepancies in styling, particularly in spacing (margin-right and margin-bottom) around Select components within a demo setup, potentially due to hard-coded styles overriding more flexible CSS settings."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the styling of the Select component in the demo. The files related to this might include the style configurations for the Select component. The specific margin styles observed in the bug report and images suggest an issue in CSS settings, typically managed in files like 'style.js' and 'main.scss' for that component. Fixing the specificity or the absolute values in these files may resolve the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a styling issue where certain styles in the Select component demo are applied too specifically, affecting other demos as well. The images show that the CSS for the 'next-select' class has specific margin styles which might be causing layout issues in the demo."
