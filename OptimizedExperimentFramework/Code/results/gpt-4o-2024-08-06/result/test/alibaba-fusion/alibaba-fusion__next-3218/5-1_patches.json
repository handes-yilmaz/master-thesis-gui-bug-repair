    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report and images indicate that there is an issue with the styling of the Select component demos. The styles are too absolute, affecting other demos. Specifically, the margin settings for the `.next-select` class are causing layout issues.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe problem is likely due to the hardcoded CSS styles for the `.next-select` class, which are applied globally and affect all instances of the Select component. The margin settings are too rigid, leading to layout problems in different demo scenarios.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to adjust the CSS styles to be more flexible or scoped appropriately. However, since the bug code snippets provided do not include CSS, we will assume the CSS is part of the same file or a related stylesheet.\n\n```javascript\n### src/select/index.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n// No CSS in the provided snippet, assuming CSS is in a related file\n=======\n/* Assuming CSS is in a related file, adjust the styles for .next-select */\n.next-select {\n    margin-right: 8px;\n    margin-bottom: 8px;\n    /* Add more flexible styling or use scoped styles */\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nIf the CSS is indeed in a separate file, you would need to locate that file and adjust the styles there. The key is to ensure that the styles are not applied globally in a way that affects all demos negatively."
