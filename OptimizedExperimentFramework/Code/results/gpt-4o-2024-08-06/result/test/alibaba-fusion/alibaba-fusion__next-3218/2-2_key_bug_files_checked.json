        "explanation": "1. **src/select/index.jsx**: This file contains the main logic for the Select component, including configuration and transformation functions. Any issues with component behavior or configuration would likely originate here.\n\n2. **src/select/scss/mixin.scss**: This file defines mixins for the Select component's styling. The problem with rigid styles affecting other demos could be due to incorrect mixin usage or definitions.\n\n3. **src/select/scss/variable.scss**: This file contains variables for the Select component's styling. Incorrect variable values could lead to styling issues like those described in the bug report.\n\n4. **src/select/main.scss**: This file includes the main styles for the Select component. The layout and margin issues seen in the images are likely defined here, making it a key file to address the styling problems.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with the Select component's demo display, where the styling is too rigid, affecting other demos. The images show a Select component with styling issues, such as incorrect margins and layout problems, as seen in the developer tools and code editor screenshots."
