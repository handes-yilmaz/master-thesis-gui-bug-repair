        "explanation": "The bug is related to styling issues in the Select component demos. In `src/select/index.jsx`, the `Select` class is the main component where these styles are applied. The `transform` function in the same file handles property transformations and deprecated styles, which might influence the styling of the component. Adjustments here can address the style conflicts affecting the demos.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a style issue in the Select component demo where certain styles are too absolute, affecting other demos. The images show the Select component with specific CSS styles applied in the browser's developer tools, indicating styling inconsistencies or overlaps."

            "src/select/index.jsx//transform"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the styling and configuration of the Select component, which is handled in the 'transform' function. This function modifies properties and applies deprecated configurations, which might be causing styling issues across different demos. Adjustments in this function might resolve the styling conflicts.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the improper styling of Select components in a demo. The style applied to some Select demos is too rigid, causing it to affect other demos improperly."
