        "explanation": "1. **src/menu/view/item.jsx**: This file contains the logic for setting the title attribute on menu items. The `getTitle` function is responsible for generating the title text from the children elements, which is directly related to the issue described in the bug report.\n\n2. **src/config-provider/config.jsx**: This file is relevant because it might be involved in providing configuration options like `showTitle`, which could be used to control whether the title attribute is applied to menu items. The bug report mentions a potential solution involving a configuration option to toggle the title attribute.",
        "bug_scenario": "The images show a dropdown menu where the title attribute is used to display full text on hover, which is causing issues with screen readers and duplicate text according to WCAG guidelines. The title appears when hovering over menu items, showing the full text of truncated items."
