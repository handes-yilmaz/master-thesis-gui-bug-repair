    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates that the sorting icon in the table does not change the cursor to a pointer when hovered over, which is a common UI practice to indicate that an element is clickable. The image shows a table with sorting icons next to the \"Id\" column header, but the cursor does not change to a pointer when hovering over these icons.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe issue is likely in the `renderSort` method of the `Sort` component in the `src/table/base/sort.jsx` file. The `<a>` elements representing the sorting icons do not have a style that changes the cursor to a pointer.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to add a `style` attribute to the `<a>` elements to set the `cursor` property to `pointer`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/table/base/sort.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                <a\n                    key={sortOrder}\n                    className={sortStatus === sortOrder ? 'current' : ''}\n                >\n=======\n                <a\n                    key={sortOrder}\n                    className={sortStatus === sortOrder ? 'current' : ''}\n                    style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}\n                >\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"
