        "explanation": "The issue is related to the table sorting functionality where the cursor style is not set to 'pointer' when hovering over the sort icon. The 'Sort' class and its 'renderSort' method in 'src/table/base/sort.jsx' are responsible for rendering the sorting icons. Thus, adding a CSS style for the cursor in these components is necessary to fix the problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The sorting icon in the table component does not display a 'cursor: pointer' style when hovered over, indicating it is not clickable, which may confuse users."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the interactivity of the sorting icons, which is managed in the 'Sort' class within the 'renderSort' function. This function is responsible for rendering the sorting icons, and it should include appropriate cursor styling to indicate interactivity, such as 'cursor: pointer'. By modifying this function to add the cursor style, the usability issue can be resolved.",
        "bug_scenario": "The sorting icon in the table component does not display a pointer cursor when hovered over, indicating it is not interactive. This makes it unclear to users that the icon is clickable for sorting purposes."
