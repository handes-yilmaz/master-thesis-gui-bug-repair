        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Table component, and the cursor property for the sorting icon should be set to 'pointer'. The bug files include the 'sort.jsx' file where the sorting functionality is likely implemented, and the 'main.scss' file for styling changes such as adding cursor: pointer for the sort icon.",

        "explanation": "1. **src/table/header.jsx**: This file likely contains the header rendering logic where the sort icons are implemented. CSS styles or classes for these elements might be missing or incorrectly applied here.\n2. **src/table/sort.jsx**: This component is directly related to the sorting functionality. It's possible the cursor style needs to be handled within this component to cover the interaction aspect.\n3. **src/table/main.scss**: The styling for the table components is most likely in this SCSS file. Adding or correcting the `cursor: pointer` style for the sorting icon would be essential here.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes a missing cursor:pointer style for the sorting icon in a table component. Users expect the cursor to change to a pointer when hovering over the sorting icon to indicate that it is clickable, which is currently not happening."
