        "explanation": "Given the bug report, the issue lies with how numerical precision is handled in the NumberPicker component. Looking at the repository structure, `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is the most likely file where the NumberPicker component is implemented. This file would contain the logic for rendering the NumberPicker and handling the values that it displays, including how increments and precision are managed. This is why `src/number-picker/index.jsx` is relevant to the bug and likely requires modification to properly handle float precision issues, probably by modifying how the increments are calculated and displayed, potentially utilizing formatting functions to ensure the display value is accurate and consistent with user expectations.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the computation of decimal numbers using JavaScript in the browser Safari, where adding 0.01 to 4.02 results in a float representation issue causing 4.02 + 0.01 to equal 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03. This float precision issue leads to a display error in the NumberPicker component, which is supposed to represent numbers with a precision of 2 decimal places."

        "explanation": "The bug is clearly located in the NumberPicker component, so the primary suspect is 'src/number-picker/index.jsx', where the NumberPicker logic is implemented. Given this is a floating point arithmetic issue, it may also intersect with utility functions that handle number precision or formatting, likely found in 'src/util/string.js' where such operations might be centralized.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the NumberPicker component when using JS floating point precision. In Safari, adding a step value of 0.01 to 4.02 results in a floating point error (4.029999999999999 instead of 4.03). This error leads to incorrect display behavior when incrementing the NumberPicker's value."
