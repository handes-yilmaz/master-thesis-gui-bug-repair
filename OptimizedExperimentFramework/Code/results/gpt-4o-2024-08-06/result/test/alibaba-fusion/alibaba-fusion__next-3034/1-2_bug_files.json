        "explanation": "These files within the `/src/upload/` directory are likely responsible for the rendering of the upload list and handling upload item interactions. The `upload.jsx` file may contain the main logic for the component, `list.jsx` is probably responsible for rendering each uploaded item, and `util.js` might manage utility functions for handling uploads. These are where the modification to add delete functionality within `itemRender` should be implemented or fixed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with the Upload component's `itemRender` functionality lacking a delete feature in version 1.22.0. The image illustrates that there is no option to delete an uploaded image, which is expected behavior."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the `Upload` component being unable to delete an uploaded item. This functionality is likely managed or should be implemented in `src/upload/upload.jsx` where components and UI interactions are defined. Additionally, `src/upload/util.js` may contain utility functions related to file manipulation that might lack the necessary deletion logic.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows an upload component with files listed, but it's missing a delete function for the uploaded item. This is occurring when using the 'itemRender' feature in version 1.22.0."
