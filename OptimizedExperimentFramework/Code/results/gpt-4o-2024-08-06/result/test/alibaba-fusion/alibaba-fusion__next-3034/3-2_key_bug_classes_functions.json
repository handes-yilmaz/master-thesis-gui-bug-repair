        "explanation": "The bug is related to the inability to delete files in the upload component. The 'List' class in 'list.jsx' handles the rendering of file lists and includes functions like 'handleClose', which is responsible for file deletion. Other functions like 'getTextList', 'getImageList', and 'getPictureCardList' are responsible for rendering the files and include logic for handling file operations, making them relevant to the bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows an upload component where a file (IMG.png) cannot be deleted. The delete functionality is missing when using itemRender in version 1.22.0."

        "explanation": "The 'List' class in 'src/upload/list.jsx' is responsible for rendering the file list and handling file operations such as deletion. The 'handleClose' function is specifically designed to handle the removal of files, which is directly related to the missing delete functionality. The 'render' function constructs the UI and would need to properly incorporate delete actions when 'itemRender' is used.",
