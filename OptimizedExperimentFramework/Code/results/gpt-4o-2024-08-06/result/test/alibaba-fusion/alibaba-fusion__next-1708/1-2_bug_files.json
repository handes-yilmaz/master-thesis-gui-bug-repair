        "explanation": "These files are related to the TreeSelect and Tree components which are most likely responsible for rendering tree nodes and handling selection logic. The issue with duplicate keys is typically addressed in the component logic handling the rendering of items, and these files likely contain the logic related to nodes rendering and their respective key assignments.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the TreeSelect component when disabled items are selected by default. The warning about duplicate keys suggests that the rendering process encounters multiple items with the same key, leading to issues with maintaining component identity."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the TreeSelect component functionality. The files src/tree-select/index.jsx and src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx are responsible for the component's implementation and logic, including handling of keys and disabled items. Fixing the bug likely requires changes in these files to ensure unique keys and proper handling of default selected and disabled items.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a TreeSelect component where using disabled items with default selection causes duplicate labels in the input box. The error message warns about duplicate children with the same key, causing potential duplication or omission of components."
