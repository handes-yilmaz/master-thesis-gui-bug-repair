    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves a `TreeSelect` component where multiple selection with disabled items and default values leads to duplicate labels in the input field. The console warning indicates that there are two children with the same key, which suggests that the keys for the tree nodes are not unique. This can cause issues with React's reconciliation process, leading to duplicated or omitted nodes.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue likely stems from the way keys are generated or assigned to tree nodes. In the `src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx` file, the `updateCache` function is responsible for generating keys for nodes. If the keys are not unique, it can lead to the warning and the observed behavior.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that each node has a unique key. This can be done by modifying the key generation logic in the `updateCache` function.\n\n```javascript\n### src/tree-select/tree-select.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst key = item.key || pos;\n=======\nconst key = `${pos}-${value}`;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the key is unique by appending the node's value to the position, which should be unique for each node. This should resolve the duplicate key warning and prevent the input field from displaying duplicate labels."
