    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves a TypeScript type mismatch error for the `onBlur` event in a `TextArea` component. The error message indicates that the `onBlur` event handler is expected to have a type of `() => void`, but it is being assigned a function with a signature of `(event: MouseEvent<Element, MouseEvent>) => void`. This discrepancy arises because the `onBlur` event handler should accept an event parameter, typically of type `React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`, rather than having no parameters.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is located in the `types/input/index.d.ts` file, where the `onBlur` property is defined for the `TextAreaProps` interface. The current type definition for `onBlur` is `() => void`, which does not match the expected signature for an event handler that receives an event object.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to update the type definition of the `onBlur` property to accept a `React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>` parameter.\n\n```javascript\n### types/input/index.d.ts\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    /** \n     * 失去焦点时候触发的回调\n     */\n    onBlur?: () => void;\n=======\n    /** \n     * 失去焦点时候触发的回调\n     */\n    onBlur?: (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => void;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `onBlur` event handler can correctly receive and handle the focus event, aligning with the expected TypeScript type signature."
