    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image and bug report indicate an issue with a slider component where the left arrow is disabled when it shouldn't be. This occurs when the `slidesToShow` is greater than `slideCount`, `infinite` is set to `false`, and `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`. The left arrow should be enabled to allow navigation, but it is incorrectly disabled.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue likely resides in the `Arrow` component, specifically in the `isDisabled` method. This method determines whether the arrow should be disabled based on the current slide index and other properties. The logic for enabling/disabling the arrows needs to be adjusted to account for the conditions described in the bug report.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `isDisabled` method in `src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx` to ensure the left arrow is not disabled when `slidesToShow` is greater than `slideCount` and `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`.\n\n```javascript\n### src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) {\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        // 向前箭头：当前是第 0 个\n        if (type === 'prev') {\n            return currentSlide <= 0;\n        }\n=======\n        if (slideCount <= slidesToShow) {\n            return currentSlide <= 0;\n        }\n\n        // 向前箭头：当前是第 0 个\n        if (type === 'prev') {\n            return currentSlide <= 0 && !centerMode;\n        }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The condition `slideCount <= slidesToShow` should not automatically disable the arrow. Instead, it should only disable the arrow if `currentSlide` is `0` and not in `centerMode`.\n- This change ensures that the left arrow is enabled when `defaultActiveIndex` is not `0`, allowing users to navigate back even if `slidesToShow` is greater than `slideCount`."
