        "explanation": "1. **src/slider/slider.jsx**: This file contains the main Slider component where properties like `slidesToShow`, `infinite`, and `defaultActiveIndex` are defined and used. The logic for enabling or disabling arrows based on these properties is likely handled here.\n\n2. **src/slider/slick/arrow.jsx**: This file manages the arrow components, including their enabled/disabled state. The `isDisabled` method checks conditions to disable the arrows, which is directly related to the issue described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The left arrow in the slider is disabled when it should be active, given the conditions: `slidesToShow` is greater than `slidesCount`, `infinite` is false, and `defaultActiveIndex` is not 0."
