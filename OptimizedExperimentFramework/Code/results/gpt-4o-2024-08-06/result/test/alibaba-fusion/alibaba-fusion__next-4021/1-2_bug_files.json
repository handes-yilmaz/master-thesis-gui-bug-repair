        "explanation": "These files in the 'number-picker' directory are likely responsible for handling the input logic and value validation of the NumberPicker component. The 'number-picker.jsx' file specifically might contain logic related to handling 'onChange' and 'onBlur' events and value correction, which appears to be where the bug is occurring.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the NumberPicker component. When users input a number greater than the maximum allowed value, it does not trigger an 'onChange' event. Instead, the number gets automatically corrected on 'onBlur', causing a discrepancy in displayed numbers and actual values, particularly affecting item prices."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug pertains to the functionality of the NumberPicker component. Files like 'src/number-picker/index.jsx' and 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx' likely contain the implementation logic for handling input values, limits, and event triggers like onChange and onBlur. These files need edits to ensure proper handling of maximum limits and event firing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is in the NumberPicker component where users can input a value exceeding the maximum allowed limit. Despite having a visual limit, users can still enter a larger number, and onBlur event corrects the value automatically without triggering onChange. This leads to inconsistencies like the number growing without the price changing."
