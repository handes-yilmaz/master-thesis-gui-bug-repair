        "explanation": "The files in the 'src/cascader/' directory are directly related to the Cascader component. The 'cascader.jsx' is the main component file, 'index.jsx' likely serves as the entry point for the component, and 'utils.js' could contain utility functions that might handle tooltip or title logic. These files would be relevant to introducing a feature to remove title information.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report mentions a need for an API in the Cascader component to allow for the removal of title information. The accompanying image shows a user interface where a tooltip or title is displayed, and the goal is to have the ability to remove this title if needed."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Cascader component, which is evident from the bug report. The relevant files for the Cascader component are likely to be `src/cascader/cascader.jsx` for the main component logic and `src/cascader/utils.js` for any utility functions involved in rendering or managing tooltip information. This is where modifications would be needed to introduce an API to conditionally remove title attributes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The screenshot shows a UI component with an undesired tooltip displaying the full content as a title on hover. The request is to provide an API to remove this title information from being displayed."
