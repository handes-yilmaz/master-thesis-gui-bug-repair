The logic for displaying the title and positioning the close button would be defined here.\n\n2. **src/dialog/main.scss**: This is where the style definitions for the dialog are located. The issue with alignment and overlapping is probably related to the CSS properties defined here.\n\n3. **src/dialog/style.js**: This file likely contains additional styling or style configurations for the dialog component that could affect how elements are rendered when the title is missing.",

Issues with the positioning and visibility of elements like the close button are generally addressed in these JSX and SCSS files, which manage both the component layout and styles.",
