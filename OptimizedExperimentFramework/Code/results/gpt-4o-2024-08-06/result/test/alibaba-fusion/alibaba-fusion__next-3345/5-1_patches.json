    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates an issue with the position of the close button in a dialog when there is no title. The image shows that the close button overlaps with the dialog content, which is not the intended behavior.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe problem likely arises because the layout does not account for the absence of a title, causing the close button to be misaligned. The dialog's CSS or layout logic might not be adjusting the position of the close button correctly when the title is missing.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the provided code snippet from `src/dialog/dialog.jsx`, the `renderInner` function is responsible for rendering the dialog's inner content, including the title and close button. The issue might be related to how the `title` prop is handled in the layout.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the layout logic to ensure the close button is correctly positioned even when the title is absent. This can be done by modifying the `renderInner` method to conditionally apply styles or layout adjustments based on the presence of a title.\n\n```javascript\n### src/dialog/dialog.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        return (\n            <Inner\n                prefix={prefix}\n                className={className}\n                title={title}\n                footer={footer}\n                footerAlign={footerAlign}\n=======\n        const hasTitle = !!title;\n        return (\n            <Inner\n                prefix={prefix}\n                className={className}\n                title={title}\n                hasTitle={hasTitle}\n                footer={footer}\n                footerAlign={footerAlign}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that the `Inner` component uses the `hasTitle` prop to adjust the layout accordingly. This might involve adding CSS rules or conditional rendering logic within the `Inner` component to handle the absence of a title."
