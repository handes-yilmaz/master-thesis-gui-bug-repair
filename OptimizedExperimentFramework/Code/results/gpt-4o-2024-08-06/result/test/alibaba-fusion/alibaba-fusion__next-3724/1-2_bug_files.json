        "explanation": "The files in the 'transfer/view/' directory are related to the Transfer component. The 'transfer.jsx' is likely responsible for the overall logic and rendering of the Transfer component, while 'transfer-panel.jsx' might handle specific UI functionalities related to the panel, such as search capabilities. Given the bug description, changes to these files would be necessary to implement independent control of searchProps for each panel.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the Transfer component where there is a need to control the searchProps individually for the left and right search boxes. Currently, the display is incorrect, showing the right side without a search field."

        ],
        "explanation": "These files are responsible for the core functionality and UI of the Transfer component. The issue appears to be with the display and control of the search boxes within the Transfer component, likely involving rendering logic in these core component files.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the Transfer component, specifically with controlling the search boxes on either side independently. The image shows a UI where only the left search box is functioning, while the right search box is not displaying, indicating a possible bug in rendering or search functionality on the right side."
