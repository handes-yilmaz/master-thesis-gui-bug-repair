        "explanation": "The bug relates to controlling the search boxes individually for the left and right panels in the Transfer component. The 'TransferPanel' class is central to rendering these panels and contains the 'renderSearch' function, which is responsible for rendering the search box based on props. The 'render' function also plays a role in conditionally rendering components within the panel, including the search box. Adjustments in these areas would allow for separate configurations of the search boxes on each panel.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a feature in the Transfer component that allows separately controlling the search boxes on the left and right panels. The image shows a user discussing the need to hide the search box on the right panel while keeping it on the left."

        "explanation": "The `TransferPanel` class in `transfer-panel.jsx` is responsible for rendering each panel in the Transfer component, including the search functionality. The `renderSearch` function is specifically responsible for displaying the search box, and modifications here would allow separate control over each panel's search box. The `render` function orchestrates the rendering process and would likely require adjustments to conditionally render search boxes based on the new requirements.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the need to control search boxes separately on the left and right panels of a Transfer component. The image shows a UI with a Transfer component where only the left search box should be displayed while the right one should not."
