        "explanation": "The 'Group' class in 'group.jsx' is responsible for rendering menu groups, and its 'render' method maps over the 'children' prop. The error indicates that 'children' may include undefined elements, leading to attempts to access 'className' on undefined. This requires validation or filtering of 'children' to ensure all are defined before mapping over them.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs when trying to render a menu group in a React application. The error message indicates that there is an 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'className' of undefined'. This suggests that the code is attempting to access the 'className' property of an undefined object, likely due to improper handling of children components within a menu group."

        "explanation": "The Group component in 'src/menu/view/group.jsx' is responsible for rendering menu groups and their children. The error occurs during the rendering process, specifically when mapping over the children to apply class names. The 'render' method attempts to access 'className' on undefined children, indicating that the handling of children elements is flawed, likely due to spaces being misinterpreted as separate children.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to a rendering issue in the Menu component's Group/SubMenu where spaces are being interpreted as multiple children. This results in an error when trying to access the 'className' property of an undefined object. The console shows an 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'className' of undefined' which occurs in the Group component."
