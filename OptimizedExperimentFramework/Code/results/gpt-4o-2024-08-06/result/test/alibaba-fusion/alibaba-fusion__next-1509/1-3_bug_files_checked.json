        "explanation": "1. **src/config-provider/index.jsx**: This file likely contains the implementation for the 'ConfigProvider', which is supposed to apply the 'popupContainer' configuration. Investigating this file can help determine why the configuration is not being passed or applied to the 'Dialog'.\n\n2. **src/dialog/dialog.jsx**: The 'Dialog' component implementation is in this file. It is necessary to understand how 'Dialog' accepts and applies configurations, particularly related to 'popupContainer'.\n\n3. **src/overlay/popup.jsx**: Since the issue pertains to 'popupContainer', and considering that 'Dialog' uses pop-up like behavior, this file might be responsible for the actual rendering of the pop-up container that is malfunctioning.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue described in the bug report and images is that the 'popupContainer' configuration on 'ConfigProvider' is not affecting the 'Dialog' component as expected. The dialog is supposed to integrate smoothly within the layout provided via 'ConfigProvider', but as seen in the image, there is a problem with the dialog positioning or appearance."

        "explanation": "The issue relates to the Dialog component not recognizing or applying the `popupContainer` settings from ConfigProvider, affecting how popups are rendered inside the Dialog. The files `src/dialog/dialog.jsx` and `src/config-provider/config.jsx` are relevant as they likely contain the logic for the Dialog component and the configuration settings from the ConfigProvider, respectively. Adjusting these files will address how configurations are utilized by the Dialog component.",
        "bug_scenario": "The ConfigProvider's popupContainer configuration is not affecting the Dialog component, which is causing display issues as shown in the image where a calendar dropdown is not correctly positioned relative to the Dialog component."
