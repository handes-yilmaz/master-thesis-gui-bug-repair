    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue reported is a TypeError: \"Cannot read property 'pos' of undefined\" in the `tree.js` file. This error occurs when trying to access the `pos` property of an object that is `undefined`. The error is likely due to an attempt to add a property to an object that is not extensible or is `undefined`.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe error trace and the code snippet indicate that the problem arises in the `preHandleData` function, specifically when trying to assign `item.pos`. The `item` object might be `undefined` or not properly initialized, leading to the error when trying to access or assign properties.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that `item` is properly initialized and is an object before attempting to assign properties to it. We can add a check to ensure `item` is defined and is an object.\n\n```javascript\n### src/tree/view/tree.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        data.map((item, index) => {\n            // 为了兼容之前的实现 保留非法节点\n            if (item.illegalFlag) {\n                return item;\n            }\n\n            const { children } = item;\n            const pos = `${prefix}-${index}`;\n            let { key } = item;\n\n            item.pos = pos;\n            item.level = level;\n=======\n        data.map((item, index) => {\n            // 为了兼容之前的实现 保留非法节点\n            if (!item || typeof item !== 'object' || item.illegalFlag) {\n                return item;\n            }\n\n            const { children } = item;\n            const pos = `${prefix}-${index}`;\n            let { key } = item;\n\n            item.pos = pos;\n            item.level = level;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a check to ensure `item` is defined and is an object before proceeding with the rest of the logic. This should prevent the error from occurring by ensuring that `item` is always a valid object when accessed."
