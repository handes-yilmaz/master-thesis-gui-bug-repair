    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates that when an `id` attribute is added to the `Rating` component, the `onChange` event is triggered twice upon a single click. This is likely due to the component's internal logic handling the click event in a way that causes the `onChange` callback to be called more than once.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the provided code snippet from `src/rating/rating.jsx`, the `handleClick` method is responsible for handling click events and triggering the `onChange` callback. The issue might be related to the logic that determines when to call `onChange`.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `onChange` callback is only called once per click. This can be achieved by refining the logic in the `handleClick` method.\n\n```javascript\n### src/rating/rating.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        this.props.onChange(isReset ? 0 : newValue);\n        setTimeout(() => {\n            this.setState({ clicked: false });\n        }, 100);\n        this.setState({\n            cleanedValue: isReset ? newValue : null,\n        });\n=======\n        if (!this.state.clicked) {\n            this.props.onChange(isReset ? 0 : newValue);\n            this.setState({ clicked: true }, () => {\n                setTimeout(() => {\n                    this.setState({ clicked: false });\n                }, 100);\n            });\n            this.setState({\n                cleanedValue: isReset ? newValue : null,\n            });\n        }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Condition Check**: Added a condition to check if the component is already in a \"clicked\" state. This prevents the `onChange` callback from being called multiple times for a single click.\n- **State Management**: The `clicked` state is set to `true` when the `onChange` is triggered, and reset to `false` after a short delay, allowing subsequent clicks to trigger the event again."
