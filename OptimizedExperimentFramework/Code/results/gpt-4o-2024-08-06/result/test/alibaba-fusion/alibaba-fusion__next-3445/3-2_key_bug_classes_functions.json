        "explanation": "The issue is within the 'Rating' component. The 'onChange' handler is being called twice when the 'id' attribute is present, suggesting that there is a problem in how the 'Rating' component handles events. Since the description and image focus on the 'onChange' event and this component, it is likely that the logic within this component related to event handling is flawed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when an 'id' attribute is added to the 'Rating' component. Upon changing the score, the 'onChange' event is triggered twice, leading to duplicate logs in the console for a single click."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The issue is likely within the 'Rating' component implementation in 'src/rating/rating.jsx'. The 'onChange' event handler is being triggered twice, which may be due to how the component handles the 'id' attribute or binds events. Examining the logic around user interactions and event triggering within this component is necessary to resolve the issue. The skeleton does not provide specific functions, but the problem will be within the Rating component's methods handling user input and state updates.",
        "bug_scenario": "When the 'Rating' component has an 'id' attribute, clicking to change the score triggers the 'onChange' event twice, resulting in two logs being printed for one click."
