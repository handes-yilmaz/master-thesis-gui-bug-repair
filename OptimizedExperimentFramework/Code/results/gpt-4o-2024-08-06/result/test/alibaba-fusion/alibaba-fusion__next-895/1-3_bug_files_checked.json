        "explanation": "The issue is related to the navigation (Nav) component where items without icons should not display blank spaces. The relevant files likely handling these components and their appearance are located in the 'nav' directory. 'nav.jsx' might define the structure of the navigation component, 'item.jsx' could define the behavior of individual items, and 'style.js' would contain the style rules that could cause the blank spaces to appear.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the 'iconOnly' mode of the navigation component (Nav), items not configured with an icon are displaying a blank space, which is not the expected behavior. The screenshot shows a vertical navigation bar with avatars and some blank spaces where no icons are configured, revealing a dropdown containing 'Item 3.'"

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the visual display of navigation items when using the Nav component in iconOnly mode. The relevant files likely include 'nav.jsx' and 'item.jsx' in the 'src/nav/' directory, as these files would handle the rendering and item management logic of the navigation component. Additionally, 'style.js' may contain CSS or styling adjustments necessary to handle elements correctly when icons are absent.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the Nav component using iconOnly mode, items without a configured icon display as blank spaces. The attached image shows a vertical navigation menu with several items, some of which appear as empty elements instead of hidden or adjusted elements when no icon is configured."
