        "explanation": "The issue involves the 'Select' component not displaying the 'defaultValue' due to 'fillProps' not properly handling empty dataSources. The main files of interest are:\n\n1. **src/select/select.jsx**: This is the main component file where the Select component is defined and where props like 'fillProps' and 'defaultValue' are likely managed.\n2. **src/select/data-store.js**: This file might manage the internal data logic and would be relevant if the data fetching or state management is malfunctioning when dataSource is empty.\n3. **src/select/util.js**: Utility functions relevant to data management and prop processing which could affect how 'fillProps' is used in handling dataSource and defaultValue. \n\nThese files are critical as they likely handle how default values and properties are set and used in the Select component.",

        "explanation": "The issue involves the Select component's behavior when rendering with default values and fillProps. The files likely responsible for this behavior are located in the 'select' directory: \n  1. 'select.jsx' - This file generally contains the main logic for rendering and managing the Select component, including handling of props such as fillProps and defaultValue.\n  2. 'data-store.js' - Responsible for managing the data associated with the Select component, issues with data handling when the dataSource is empty might originate here.\n  3. 'util.js' - Utility functions that could impact how props are processed and might contain the logic that mishandles fillProps when dataSource is empty.",
        "bug_scenario": "The expected behavior when rendering a Select component with a default value is for the value ('jack' in this case) to be displayed. However, the actual outcome is that the value is not shown when the fillProps option is used with an empty dataSource."
