        "explanation": "The CascaderSelect component is directly mentioned in the bug report and is in the stack trace, so its main file (cascader-select.jsx) and its entry point (index.jsx) are relevant. The Cascader component (cascader.jsx) is potentially interacting with CascaderSelect regarding the popup management. Since the bug occurs with 'popupProps', the popup-v2.jsx file within the overlay directory is also inspected because it may contain the implementation details that handle the popup functionality in version 2.",
        "bug_scenario": "When the 'v2: true' property is set in the CascaderSelect's popupProps, an error occurs indicating that it cannot read properties of null, specifically 'getInstance'. This suggests that there is an issue with the CascaderSelect component when interacting with the popup in v2 mode."

        "explanation": "The bug report indicates an error related to the CascaderSelect component's popupProps configuration. The relevant files likely include 'cascader-select.jsx' where the component logic is defined, and 'popup-v2.jsx' which may handle the implementation of the popup feature currently causing the error.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a TypeError occurring when using the CascaderSelect component with popupProps set to v2: true, causing a 'Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getInstance')' error."
