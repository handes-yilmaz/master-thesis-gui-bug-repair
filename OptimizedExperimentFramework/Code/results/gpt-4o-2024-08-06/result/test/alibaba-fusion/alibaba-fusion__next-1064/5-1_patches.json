    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates that the `Field` component should not modify the input data. The image shows that the `this.values` property is being set directly from `options.values` or initialized as an empty object. This can lead to unintended modifications of the input data if `options.values` is a reference to an external object.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe issue is located in the constructor of the `Field` class, specifically at the line:\n\n```javascript\nthis.values = options.values || {};\n```\n\nThis line directly assigns `options.values` to `this.values`, which can lead to modifications of the original `options.values` object if it is not cloned.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix this issue, we should ensure that `this.values` is a clone of `options.values` rather than a direct reference. This can be achieved by using a method like `Object.assign` or the spread operator to create a shallow copy.\n\n```javascript\n### src/field/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nthis.values = options.values || {};\n=======\nthis.values = Object.assign({}, options.values) || {};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that `this.values` is a separate object, preventing any unintended modifications to the original `options.values`."
