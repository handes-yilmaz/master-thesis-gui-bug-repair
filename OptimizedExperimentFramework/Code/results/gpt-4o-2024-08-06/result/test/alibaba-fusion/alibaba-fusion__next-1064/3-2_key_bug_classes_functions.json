        "explanation": "The issue resides in the 'Field' component, particularly in how it handles initial values. The line 'this.values = options.values || {};' suggests that the component is attempting to initialize its 'values' property with data from 'options.values'. However, this may not be functioning as intended, leading to the inability to modify incoming data. The initialization logic does not handle updates or changes to 'options.values', which could be causing the bug where the data remains static or defaults to an empty object rather than reflecting changes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue where the 'Field' component cannot modify the incoming data. The scenario involves an incorrect or unintended behavior where the field values are not being updated appropriately when data is passed to the component."

        "explanation": "The 'Field' class in 'src/field/index.js' is responsible for handling field values. The line 'this.values = options.values || {};' suggests that 'this.values' should hold the incoming values or default to an empty object. If the Field component is not modifying incoming data properly, the issue might lie in how 'this.values' is being assigned or used throughout the class.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates that the Field component is not able to modify incoming data as expected. The image shows a portion of the code where 'this.values' is assigned the value of 'options.values' or an empty object if 'options.values' is undefined."
