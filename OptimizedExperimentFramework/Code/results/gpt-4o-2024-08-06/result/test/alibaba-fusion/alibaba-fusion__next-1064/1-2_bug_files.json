        "explanation": "The file 'src/field/index.js' contains the code responsible for initializing field values, which directly uses options and allows unintended modifications. This is the root cause of the issue described in the bug report and observed in the screenshot.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is in the Field component where the values of a field can be modified directly, which is not intended. This behavior is observed in the code line 'this.values = options.values || {};' which sets the field values to the passed options, allowing modifications to those values."

        "bug_files": [
            "src/field/index.js",
            "src/field/utils.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to how the 'values' are initialized and handled within the Field component. The relevant file is 'src/field/index.js', where the line of code setting 'this.values = options.values || {};' is highlighted. Any logic determining how options are processed or how 'values' is used is crucial in understanding and fixing the bug. Additionally, 'src/field/utils.js' might contain utility functions that are being used in 'index.js', potentially affecting the behavior of the 'values' field.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue in the Field component is that it does not allow changes to the input data. Specifically, there's a part in the code where the values are set based on the 'options.values' or default to an empty object. This might be preventing changes if the input data structure or reference needs to be altered."
