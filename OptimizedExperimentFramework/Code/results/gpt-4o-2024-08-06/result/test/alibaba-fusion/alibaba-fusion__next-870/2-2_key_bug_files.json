        "explanation": "1. **src/overlay/popup.jsx**: This file handles the rendering and positioning of the overlay popup. The issue with the popup appearing in the wrong position is likely due to incorrect calculations or handling of scroll positions.\n\n2. **src/overlay/utils/position.js**: This file contains functions related to element positioning. The problem with the overlay's position when there are two scrollbars suggests that the calculations for element positioning might not be accounting for all scroll offsets correctly.\n\n3. **src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx**: This file is responsible for the NumberPicker component. The style error related to 'innerBefore' and 'innerAfter' suggests that there might be an issue with how styles are applied or how the component is structured.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes two issues: 1) The overlay popup appears in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars, specifically when interacting with a datepicker. 2) The NumberPicker component has a style error related to 'innerBefore' not supporting 'innerAfter'. The images show UI elements with misaligned overlays and incorrect styles for input fields."
