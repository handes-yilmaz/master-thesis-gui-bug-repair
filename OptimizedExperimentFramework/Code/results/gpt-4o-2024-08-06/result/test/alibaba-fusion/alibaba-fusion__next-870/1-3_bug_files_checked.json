        "explanation": "1. **Overlay Issue**: The overlay issue suggests a problem with how the position is calculated or displayed when there are multiple scrollbars. This would likely involve `popup.jsx` and `utils/position.js` handling the overlay positioning logic.\n\n2. **NumberPicker Style Issue**: The NumberPicker displays incorrect styling related to 'innerBefore' and missing 'innerAfter'. The components involved are `number-picker.jsx` for JSX structure and `scss/mixin.scss` for the styling logic, which need adjustments to fix the style issues.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issues reported involve a datepicker overlay appearing in the wrong position when there are two scrollbars, and a styling error with the NumberPicker component where the 'innerBefore' style is incorrect and 'innerAfter' is not supported. The images depict incorrect UI positioning and styling, which are typical CSS or JS positioning problems."

        "explanation": "1) Files related to the Overlay component (e.g., overlay.jsx, position.js) are likely to have issues with positioning logic and need adjustment to correctly calculate and position elements within scrollable regions. 2) Files related to the NumberPicker component, including number-picker.jsx and related style files (mixin.scss, variable.scss), are possibly related to incorrect styles or lack of support for certain CSS styles (innerBefore/innerAfter issue). The two images show the incorrect overlay placement and the styling issues in the number picker, confirming these observations.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes two issues: 1) The overlay is positioned incorrectly when there are two scrollbars, especially noticeable with the DatePicker popup, which appears in the wrong location when scrolling. 2) The NumberPicker component exhibits styling errors, particularly with the 'innerBefore' style not supporting 'innerAfter' correctly."
