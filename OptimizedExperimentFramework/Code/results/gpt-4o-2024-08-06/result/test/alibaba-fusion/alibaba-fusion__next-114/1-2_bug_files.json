        "explanation": "The file 'src/number-picker/index.jsx' is related to the NumberPicker component described in the bug report. The issue is specifically about how the NumberPicker is handling mathematical operations involving floating-point numbers. This component file is likely to contain the relevant logic where the additions and displays of numbers are handled, thus adjustments need to be made here to address the precision issue noted in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when using the NumberPicker component in Safari browser. Specifically, when the default value of the NumberPicker is set to 4.02, and a step of 0.01 is used, clicking the '+' button to increase the value by one step results in the value being displayed as 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03. This is due to JavaScript's handling of floating point numbers, which can lead to such precision issues."

        "bug_files": [
            "src/number-picker/index.jsx"
        ],
        "explanation": "The file 'src/number-picker/index.jsx' is likely responsible for handling the logic and rendering of the NumberPicker component. Since the bug involves the display of numbers resulting from floating-point operations in this component, the logic handling these calculations (likely in index.jsx) needs to be adjusted to account for JavaScript's floating-point precision issues.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug relates to the incorrect output of a floating-point arithmetic operation in JavaScript within the NumberPicker component. Specifically, when using Safari, adding 0.01 to 4.02 results in a display of 4.029999999999999 instead of the expected 4.03. This discrepancy is due to the precision issues inherent to floating-point calculations in JavaScript, which affects the display values in the NumberPicker."
