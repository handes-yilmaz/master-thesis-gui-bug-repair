    "1/1": "To address the bug described in the report, we need to focus on the issue of floating-point precision in JavaScript, which is causing the `NumberPicker` component to display incorrect values when incrementing numbers. The problem arises because JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic can lead to precision errors, such as `4.02 + 0.01` resulting in `4.029999999999999` instead of `4.03`.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe root cause of the bug is the inherent imprecision of floating-point arithmetic in JavaScript. When performing arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction with floating-point numbers, the results can sometimes be slightly off due to how numbers are represented in binary. This is a common issue in many programming languages, not just JavaScript.\n\n### Bug Location\nThe bug is likely located in the methods responsible for incrementing and decrementing the number in the `NumberPicker` component. Specifically, the `upStep` and `downStep` methods are where the arithmetic operations are performed. These methods need to be adjusted to handle floating-point precision correctly.\n\n### Patch\nTo fix the issue, we can use a technique that involves scaling the numbers to integers before performing arithmetic operations and then scaling them back to floating-point numbers. This approach helps avoid precision errors.\n\nHere's the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/number-picker/index.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    upStep(val) {\n        const {step, min} = this.props;\n        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();\n        let result;\n        if (typeof val === 'number') {\n            result = (precisionFactor * val + precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;\n        } else {\n            result = min === -Infinity ? step : min;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    downStep(val) {\n        const {step, min} = this.props;\n        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();\n        let result;\n        if (typeof val === 'number') {\n            result = (precisionFactor * val - precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;\n\n            // in chrome browser: 0.3 - 0.2 = 0.09999999999, we should creact to 0.1\n            const precision = this.getPrecision();\n            if (precision > 0) {\n                result = Number(Number(result).toFixed(precision));\n            }\n        } else {\n            result = min === -Infinity ? -step : min;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n=======\n    upStep(val) {\n        const {step, min} = this.props;\n        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();\n        let result;\n        if (typeof val === 'number') {\n            result = (precisionFactor * val + precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;\n            result = Number(result.toFixed(this.getPrecision()));\n        } else {\n            result = min === -Infinity ? step : min;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    downStep(val) {\n        const {step, min} = this.props;\n        const precisionFactor = this.getPrecisionFactor();\n        let result;\n        if (typeof val === 'number') {\n            result = (precisionFactor * val - precisionFactor * step) / precisionFactor;\n            result = Number(result.toFixed(this.getPrecision()));\n        } else {\n            result = min === -Infinity ? -step : min;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The `upStep` and `downStep` methods have been modified to use `Number(result.toFixed(this.getPrecision()))` to ensure that the result is rounded to the correct precision after performing the arithmetic operation. This helps mitigate the floating-point precision issue by explicitly controlling the number of decimal places in the result.\n- The `getPrecision()` method is used to determine the number of decimal places to round to, based on the `precision` prop and the `step` value. This ensures that the component behaves consistently with the specified precision."
