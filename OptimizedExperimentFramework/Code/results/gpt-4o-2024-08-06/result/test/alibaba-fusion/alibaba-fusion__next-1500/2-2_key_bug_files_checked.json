        "explanation": "1. **src/table/base/header.jsx**: This file handles the rendering of the table header, including the integration of sorting, filtering, and resizing components. The issue likely arises from how these components interact when both fixedHeader and resizable are enabled.\n\n2. **src/table/fixed/header.jsx**: This file manages the fixed header functionality. Since the bug involves fixed headers, this file is crucial for understanding how the fixed header is implemented and interacts with other components.\n\n3. **src/table/base/filter.jsx**: This file is responsible for the filter component in the table header. The bug involves the filter button, so this file is relevant to ensure the filter component is functioning correctly when combined with other features like resizing.",
        "bug_scenario": "When using the Table component with both fixedHeader and resizable options, clicking the filter button causes the header to display incorrectly."
