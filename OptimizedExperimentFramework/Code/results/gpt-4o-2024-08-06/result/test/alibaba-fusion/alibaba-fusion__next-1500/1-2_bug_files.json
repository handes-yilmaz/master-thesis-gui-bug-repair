        "explanation": "The files 'header.jsx' in 'base' and 'fixed' directories might be involved because they likely handle header rendering, which directly relates to the visual issues described. The 'resize.jsx' file may manage resizing logic that could conflict with fixed headers, while 'util.js' could contain shared utility functions affecting both features.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs when using the 'fixedHeader' and 'resizable' options together in a table component. The filter options in the header are displaying incorrectly or behaving unexpectedly."

        "explanation": "The issue involves the Table component's headers and their interaction with filtering. Files related to the header ('header.jsx'), filter functionality ('filter.jsx'), and fixed header layout ('fixed/header.jsx') are likely involved in rendering the UI components in question. The utility file ('util.js') may contain shared functions handling resizing or rendering logic that applies to these table features.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs when using the 'fixedHeader' and 'resizable' features together in the Table component. Clicking the filter button causes the header to display incorrectly, as shown in the provided screenshot. The header's filter options appear misaligned or partially hidden under adjacent header cells."
