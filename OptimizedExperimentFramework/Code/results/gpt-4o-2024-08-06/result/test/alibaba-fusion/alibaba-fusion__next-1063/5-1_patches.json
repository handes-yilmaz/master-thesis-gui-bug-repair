    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the `Field` component does not modify the input data directly. The problem seems to be related to how `this.values` is initialized and potentially modified.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image shows that `this.values` is initialized with `options.values || {}`. This means that if `options.values` is provided, it is directly assigned to `this.values`. This can lead to unintended modifications of the original `options.values` object if `this.values` is altered later in the code.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe issue is located in the constructor of the `Field` class, specifically at the line:\n\n```javascript\nthis.values = options.values || {};\n```\n\n### Solution\n\nTo prevent modifications to the original `options.values`, we should create a shallow copy of `options.values` when initializing `this.values`. This can be done using `Object.assign` or the spread operator.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/field/index.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nthis.values = options.values || {};\n=======\nthis.values = Object.assign({}, options.values) || {};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that `this.values` is a separate object, preventing any direct modifications to `options.values`."
