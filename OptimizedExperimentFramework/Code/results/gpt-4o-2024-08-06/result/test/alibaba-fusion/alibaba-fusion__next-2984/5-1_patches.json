    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report and the error message, we need to ensure that the code does not attempt to modify objects that are not extensible. The error occurs because the code is trying to add properties to an object that has been made non-extensible, possibly due to the use of libraries like Immer.\n\n### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe error message indicates that the issue is occurring in `cascader.js` at line 196. The problem arises when the code attempts to modify an object that is not extensible. This typically happens when an object is frozen or sealed, or when using libraries like Immer that create immutable data structures.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue is likely in the `updateCache` function in `src/cascader/cascader.jsx`, where the code is trying to modify the `item` object directly. We should avoid modifying the original object and instead create a new object with the desired properties.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/cascader/cascader.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        item.value = newValue;\n        v2n[newValue] = p2n[pos] = {\n            ...item,\n            pos,\n            _source: item,\n        };\n=======\n        const newItem = { ...item, value: newValue };\n        v2n[newValue] = p2n[pos] = {\n            ...newItem,\n            pos,\n            _source: item,\n        };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Original Code**: The code was directly modifying the `item` object by setting `item.value = newValue;`.\n- **Updated Code**: We create a new object `newItem` that copies all properties from `item` and includes the updated `value`. This avoids modifying the original `item` object, which may be immutable.\n\nThis change should resolve the error by ensuring that the code does not attempt to modify non-extensible objects."
