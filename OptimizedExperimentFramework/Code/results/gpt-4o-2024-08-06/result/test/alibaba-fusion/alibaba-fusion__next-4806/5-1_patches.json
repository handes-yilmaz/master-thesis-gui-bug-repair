    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\n**Bug Scenario Description:**\nThe image shows a dropdown component with multiple selectable items. The issue is that after selecting all items, the search results are not cleared automatically, and the user remains on the search results page. This can be confusing as the user might not know how to return to the full list view without manually closing and reopening the dropdown.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe component does not have a mechanism to clear the search results automatically after all items are selected. Additionally, there is no button provided to clear the search results manually.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx` file. The `handleVisibleChange` method partially addresses the visibility and search value state, but it does not handle the scenario where all items are selected. The `handleSelect` method is likely where the logic should be added to clear the search results when all items are selected.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `handleSelect` method to clear the search results when all items are selected.\n\n```javascript\n### components/cascader-select/cascader-select.tsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    handleSelect(value: unknown, data: CascaderSelectDataItem) {\n        const { multiple, changeOnSelect } = this.props;\n=======\n    handleSelect(value: unknown, data: CascaderSelectDataItem) {\n        const { multiple, changeOnSelect } = this.props;\n        \n        // Check if all items are selected and clear search results\n        if (multiple && this.state.value.length === this.props.dataSource.length) {\n            this.setState({ searchValue: '' });\n        }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a check to see if all items are selected (`this.state.value.length === this.props.dataSource.length`) and clears the `searchValue` state, which will reset the search results."
