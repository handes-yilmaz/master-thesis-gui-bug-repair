        "explanation": "The bug is related to the CascaderSelect component's search and selection functionality, which is not behaving as expected. The main functionality is likely implemented in `cascader-select.tsx` and `index.tsx`. These files would need modifications to add a mechanism for clearing the search results after selection. The test file `index-spec.tsx` should also be updated to reflect and ensure the new functionality works correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The CascaderSelect component does not clear the search results after selection, leaving the user unaware of how to continue or return to the full list. The proposed solution is to automatically clear the search results or provide a button for manual clearing."

        ],
        "explanation": "These files are related to the core functionality of the CascaderSelect component. Modifications in these files may implement the feature to automatically clear search results after selection or add a button to clear the current search field, addressing the problem outlined in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with the CascaderSelect component. When in multi-select mode with search functionality, after a user selects all results, the selection remains on the search results page. Users find it unclear how to navigate back to the complete list without closing and reopening the dropdown."
