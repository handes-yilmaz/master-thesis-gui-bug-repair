        "explanation": "The issue lies within the CascaderSelect component, where there is no mechanism to clear search results automatically or via a button after all results are selected. This functionality would likely be handled within the main CascaderSelect component class, where search and selection state management occurs.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the CascaderSelect component, when users perform a multi-select search and select all results, they remain stuck on the search results page. They are unsure how to proceed or return to the full list view without clicking outside the dropdown to reopen it. The requirement is to either automatically clear the search results after selection or provide a button to clear the current search field."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The `CascaderSelect` class in `cascader-select.tsx` is responsible for handling the selection and display logic of the CascaderSelect component. The bug is related to the component's behavior after selecting all results, which means changes in this class are necessary to implement the feature of automatically clearing search results or adding a button for clearing search criteria.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue occurs with the CascaderSelect component where, after selecting all search results, the search results page remains displayed, causing user confusion about how to proceed or return to the full list. The user must click outside the popup to reopen it to return to the list view. The requirement is to either automatically clear search results after selection or provide a button to clear the current search criteria."
