        "explanation": "These files are part of the DatePicker2 component, which is the affected component. The 'time-panel.jsx' is directly related to the time panel functionality where the error occurs. 'util.js' might contain shared functions for date handling, and 'index.jsx' could manage the component's props, including 'timePanelProps.defaultValue' that is causing the issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The DatePicker2 component shows \"Invalid Date\" error when the 'timePanelProps.defaultValue' is set. The issue likely relates to mismanaged date parsing or data handling inside the component's logic."

        "explanation": "The files related to DatePicker2 in the 'src/date-picker2/' directory are likely to be involved. The 'index.jsx' file is the main component file, which coordinates how properties are passed and values are rendered. The 'date-input.jsx' and 'time-panel.jsx' under 'panels/' deal with input and time panel which might handle the 'defaultValue'. The 'util.js' file might contain utility functions that parse or format date values, which could be used in parsing 'defaultValue'.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is exhibited in the DatePicker2 component where setting a property (timePanelProps.defaultValue) results in the display of 'Invalid Date'. The issue appears to be related to the DatePicker2 component not handling the defaultValue property correctly, causing it to display an invalid value."
