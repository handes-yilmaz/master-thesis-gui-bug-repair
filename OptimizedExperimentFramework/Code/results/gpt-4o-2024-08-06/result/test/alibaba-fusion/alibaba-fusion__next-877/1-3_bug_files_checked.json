        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Overlay component's styling where the inline content collapses. The 'main.scss' file is responsible for styling, where the 'width: 100%' fix needs to be applied. The 'overlay.jsx' file is the main component file where any logic adjustments related to rendering may also need to be addressed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs in the Overlay component where the inline content collapses unexpectedly. The fix requires adding 'width: 100%' to ensure the content doesn't collapse when it should render inline."

            "src/overlay/main.scss"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are related to the styling and implementation of the overlay component. The issue is a CSS styling one, so `overlay.jsx` and any associated styling files like `style.js` or `main.scss` would need to be modified to include the `width: 100%` style in the relevant places.",
        "bug_scenario": "The overlay content does not expand to the full width when it is inline. This causes rendering issues, as the content is collapsed to a small section on the page. Applying a CSS style of `width: 100%` to the overlay should solve the problem."
