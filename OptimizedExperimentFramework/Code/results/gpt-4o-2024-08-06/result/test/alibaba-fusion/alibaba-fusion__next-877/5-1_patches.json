    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves an overlay component where the content collapses when it is inline, and there is insufficient space for the browser to render it properly. The image shows an overlay with a message that should be displayed fully but is instead collapsed. The root cause is likely due to the overlay not having a defined width, causing it to collapse when the content is inline. Adding `width: 100%` to the overlay's style should resolve this issue by ensuring the overlay takes up the full available width.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely within the `Overlay` component's rendering logic or style application. The `wrapperStyle` or similar style properties should be updated to include `width: 100%` to prevent the content from collapsing.\n\n### Patches for Bug Files\n\n```javascript\n### src/overlay/overlay.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        wrapperStyle: PropTypes.object,\n=======\n        wrapperStyle: PropTypes.object,\n        style: { width: '100%' },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds a default style to the `Overlay` component to ensure it takes up the full width, preventing the inline content from collapsing."
