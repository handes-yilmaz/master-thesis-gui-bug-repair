        "explanation": "The `Overlay` class in the `overlay.jsx` file likely contains logic relevant to rendering and positioning the overlay component. The bug relates to the overlay not rendering correctly when content is inline, suggesting that styles and possibly rendering logic within this class need adjustment. The CSS in `main.scss` also needs updating, but the key logic is likely in the overlay component's render methods or style handling. Adding `width: 100%` to the CSS should solve the rendering issue, but understanding when and how styles are applied programmatically in `overlay.jsx` is crucial to a comprehensive fix.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves an overlay component that does not collapse properly when content is inline and there is insufficient space for rendering. The CSS style `width: 100%` needs to be added to ensure correct rendering and avoid collapse issues."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the overlay component, specifically in how it handles inline content. The 'Overlay' class in 'overlay.jsx' is responsible for rendering and managing the overlay component. Since the bug report suggests adding 'width: 100%' to solve the issue, the problem likely lies in the styling and rendering logic within this class. The absence of specific function names indicates that the issue might be more related to the overall class behavior and associated styles rather than a specific function.",
        "bug_scenario": "The overlay content does not collapse properly when inline. The overlay is positioned absolutely with top and left set to zero, but due to lack of width specification, it doesn't render correctly in limited space. The image shows the overlay content that should be collapsed but is not behaving as expected, likely because the width isn't set to 100%."
