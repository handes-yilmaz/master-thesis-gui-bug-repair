        "explanation": "The error originates from how the `dataIndex` is processed and used to fetch data. The file `src/table/util.js` contains the `fetchDataByPath` function, which attempts to parse and use the `dataIndex` string to access nested data properties. This function needs to support parsing strings of the format `'[start, end]'`. Altering this function to correctly parse such strings and return values that are not undefined will address the issue. Additionally, `src/table/index.jsx` is essential as it integrates these utility functions into the table component rendering, so any modifications to how data is read need to be reflected there as well.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves making the `dataIndex` property of the `Table` component compatible with a string format like `'[start, end]'`. The issue arises when trying to access object properties using such a format, which is not natively supported, leading to an `Uncaught TypeError`. The error message suggests that the property `'startDate,endDate'` of undefined cannot be read, which is likely due to the improper handling of the `dataIndex` string during data retrieval."

        "explanation": "The images show a part of a function fetchDataByPath within the 'util.js' file in the 'table' directory, which attempts to parse and access data using path strings. The error in the console and highlighted code in the image strongly indicate that this function does not handle complex string paths like '[start, end]' properly, leading to 'undefined' errors. Therefore, 'src/table/util.js' is a bug-related file that likely needs modification to handle such cases.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report discusses an issue with a Table component where the dataIndex does not support strings like '[start, end]'. When such strings are used, an error occurs stating \"Cannot read property 'startDate,endDate' of undefined\". This indicates a failure in fetching or handling data based on a complex key path, likely due to limitations in parsing or accessing nested data structures."
