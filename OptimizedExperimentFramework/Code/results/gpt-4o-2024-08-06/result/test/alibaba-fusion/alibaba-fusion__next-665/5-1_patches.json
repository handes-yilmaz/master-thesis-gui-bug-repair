    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report and image indicate an issue with a custom header in a table component where the \"select all\" cell is not functioning as expected. The image shows a dropdown with options related to selection states, but the functionality to customize the header cell content seems to be missing or not working correctly.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\nThe code snippet provided is from a React component for rendering the table header. The issue likely stems from the way the header cells are being rendered, specifically the customization of the cell content. The `Cell` component is used to render each header cell, but there is no indication that it supports custom content for the \"select all\" functionality.\n\n### Bug Fix\n\nTo address this issue, we need to ensure that the `Cell` component can accept and render custom content for the \"select all\" cell. This involves modifying the rendering logic to allow for custom content to be passed and displayed.\n\n```javascript\n### src/table/base/header.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n                return (\n                    <Cell\n                        {...others}\n                        {...attrs}\n                        key={j}\n                        prefix={prefix}\n                        pure={pure}\n                        rtl={rtl}\n                        cell={title}\n                        component=\"th\"\n                        align={alignHeader ? alignHeader : align}\n                        className={className}\n                        ref={this.getCellRef.bind(this, index, j)}\n                        type=\"header\"\n                    >\n                        {sortElement}\n                        {filterElement}\n                        {resizeElement}\n                    </Cell>\n                );\n=======\n                const cellContent = dataIndex === 'selectAll' ? (\n                    <CustomSelectAllComponent />\n                ) : title;\n\n                return (\n                    <Cell\n                        {...others}\n                        {...attrs}\n                        key={j}\n                        prefix={prefix}\n                        pure={pure}\n                        rtl={rtl}\n                        cell={cellContent}\n                        component=\"th\"\n                        align={alignHeader ? alignHeader : align}\n                        className={className}\n                        ref={this.getCellRef.bind(this, index, j)}\n                        type=\"header\"\n                    >\n                        {sortElement}\n                        {filterElement}\n                        {resizeElement}\n                    </Cell>\n                );\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Custom Content**: Introduced a conditional check for `dataIndex === 'selectAll'` to determine if the cell is the \"select all\" cell.\n- **Custom Component**: Used a placeholder `CustomSelectAllComponent` to render custom content for the \"select all\" cell. This component should be defined elsewhere in your codebase to handle the specific UI and logic for the \"select all\" functionality.\n- **Fallback to Title**: For other cells, the original `title` is used as the content.\n\nThis change allows the header to render custom content for the \"select all\" cell, addressing the issue described in the bug report."
