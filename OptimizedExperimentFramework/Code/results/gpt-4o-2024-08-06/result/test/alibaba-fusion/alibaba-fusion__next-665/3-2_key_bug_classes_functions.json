        "explanation": "The `Header` class in `header.jsx` is responsible for rendering the table's header, including the custom header cells. The `getCellRef` function manages cell references which could affect how selections are recognized. The `render` function constructs the header and places elements like sort, filter, and resize components. Any issues with displaying or interacting with custom header cells would likely originate in these areas of the code.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with customizing the header cell of a table component. The image shows a header with a dropdown for selection, but there seems to be an issue with the display or functionality of the selection feature."

            "src/table/base/header.jsx//Header.render"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the table header's custom cell rendering, particularly the select all functionality. The `Header` class in `header.jsx` is responsible for rendering the table's header component, including any interactive elements like sort, filter, and potentially the select all checkbox. The `render` function within this class handles the rendering logic of each cell, which is crucial for implementing the select all feature. If this checkbox isn't functioning correctly, this function is likely where the bug exists or needs to be addressed.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a table component with a custom header that includes a select all checkbox functionality. It appears that selecting the checkbox should select all corresponding items in the list, but there might be an issue with this functionality not working as intended."
