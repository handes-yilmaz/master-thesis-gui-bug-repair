        "explanation": "The files related to the Table component, particularly those dealing with the header and cell rendering (`src/table/base/header.jsx`, `src/table/base/cell.jsx`), are probably where any customization for header cells should be implemented. `src/table/index.jsx` could be responsible for overarching logic of the Table component, ensuring the header customization properly integrates with existing functionality. Likewise, `src/table/util.js` may include utility functions that are used during rendering or customization of table headers.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report is about customizing the header cell in a Table component, where the user wants to customize the header to include a select-all checkbox cell. The image depicts a table with a header row that includes a checkbox for selecting all rows, suggesting the customization might not function as expected or not be easily customizable."

            "src/table/index.jsx",
            "src/table/util.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are likely related to the bug because they are involved in rendering the table, its headers, and managing utility functions relevant to table behavior. 'header.jsx' and 'cell.jsx' are directly related to rendering individual table cells and headers. 'index.jsx' typically serves as a central file that integrates various table components, and 'util.js' might contain helper functions supporting the customization and functionality of the table header.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report indicates an issue with a custom header cell in a Table component where the cell content needs to be customizable. The attached image shows a header with a select all checkbox and a contextual dropdown, suggesting that the customization is tied to header rendering and possibly the selection functionality."
