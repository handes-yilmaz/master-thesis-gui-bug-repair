    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates a memory leak issue with the `ConfigProvider` component in a server-side rendering (SSR) scenario. The memory leak is due to the internal cache of `ConfigProvider` not being garbage collected. The image shows multiple instances of `ConfigProvider` being retained in memory, which suggests that the cache is not being cleared properly.\n\nThe root cause is identified as the `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method not being called in SSR, as noted in the linked React issue. This means that the cache removal logic in `componentWillUnmount` is not executed, leading to memory retention.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippets are in two files:\n\n1. **`src/config-provider/index.jsx`**: This file contains the `ConfigProvider` component, which uses a `Cache` instance to store context data. The `componentWillUnmount` method is supposed to remove the cache entry for the component.\n\n2. **`src/config-provider/cache.js`**: This file defines the `Cache` class used by `ConfigProvider`.\n\n### Patches to Fix the Bug\n\nTo address the memory leak, we can introduce a manual cache clearing API in the `ConfigProvider` component. This will allow the cache to be cleared explicitly, even in SSR scenarios where `componentWillUnmount` is not called.\n\n```javascript\n### src/config-provider/index.jsx\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n        childContextCache.remove(this);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return Children.only(this.props.children);\n    }\n=======\n    componentWillUnmount() {\n        childContextCache.remove(this);\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Manually clear the cache for this instance.\n     */\n    clearCache() {\n        childContextCache.remove(this);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return Children.only(this.props.children);\n    }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Manual Cache Clearing**: A new method `clearCache` is added to the `ConfigProvider` class. This method allows for manual removal of the cache entry associated with the component instance. This can be called explicitly in SSR scenarios to ensure that the cache is cleared, preventing memory leaks.\n\nThis patch provides a way to manage the cache manually, which is necessary due to the limitations of lifecycle methods in SSR environments."
