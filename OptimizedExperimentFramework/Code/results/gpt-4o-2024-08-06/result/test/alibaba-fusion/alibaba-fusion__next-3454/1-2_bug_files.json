        "explanation": "The files in the src/number-picker directory are the most likely to contain the issue since the problem is specifically with the NumberPicker component. These files likely contain the logic that handles value changes and range validation within the component. Adjustments will need to be made here to ensure that changes to the max value are detected and the component is updated accordingly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to the NumberPicker component, where changes to the maximum (max) value are not being detected and updated in real-time. This is indicated by the image, which shows that after clicking the button to increase the max value, the component does not reflect the updated maximum in its display. The red text in the image points out this lack of real-time update when the max value is changed."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the 'NumberPicker' component not updating max/min values in real time. The relevant files that likely handle these functionalities are located in the 'src/number-picker/' directory, specifically 'index.jsx' and 'number-picker.jsx', which would typically contain the core logic for managing the component's state and handling props changes.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug pertains to the 'NumberPicker' component, where changes in maximum and minimum values are not detected in real time. The image illustrates a scenario where increasing the max value does not reflect the change instantly in the component."
