        "explanation": "The issue seems to be related to how the NumberPicker component handles changes in its maximum value. The class 'NumberPicker' likely contains the logic for handling value changes, including max value tracking and updates. Since the bug is about the real-time detection of max value changes, this class is the primary candidate for investigation and fixing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the NumberPicker component where changes to the maximum value are not detected in real-time. When the max value is increased, the component does not update accordingly."

        "bug_functions": [],
        "explanation": "The issue involves the NumberPicker component not updating the maximum value in real-time. The class 'NumberPicker' in 'src/number-picker/number-picker.jsx' is likely responsible for the behavior of the component, including handling maximum and minimum values. Since the bug report mentions that changes to the maximum value are not detected, it suggests that the logic for updating or rendering the component based on these values needs to be reviewed and potentially modified.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a NumberPicker component where the maximum value is not updating in real-time when the max is incremented. The arrow points out that after clicking 'max + 1', the maximum value change is not reflected immediately in the component."
