    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Images and Root Cause\n\nThe images show JSX code where the `style` objects are being misaligned after running `eslint --fix`. The issue arises from the `key-spacing` rule with the `align: 'value'` option, which is causing the alignment to become inconsistent and visually unappealing in JSX objects.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe bug is located in the `key-spacing` rule implementation in the `lib/rules/key-spacing.js` file. The rule is responsible for enforcing consistent spacing between keys and values in object literal properties. The misalignment issue is likely due to how the rule handles alignment for JSX objects, which may not be properly accounted for in the current implementation.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the `verifyGroupAlignment` function to handle JSX objects correctly, ensuring that the alignment does not become visually unappealing.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/key-spacing.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            }\n=======\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = multiLineOptions.mode; // Fix: Use multiLineOptions mode for non-aligned cases\n            }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that when the alignment options are not explicitly set, the `multiLineOptions.mode` is used instead of `alignmentOptions.mode`, which should help maintain consistent and visually appealing alignment in JSX objects."
