        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the 'key-spacing' rule in ESLint, specifically when using the 'align: value' option. This option is supposed to align values in object literals, but it causes formatting issues in JSX style objects. The key functions responsible for checking alignment and spacing within the 'key-spacing' rule are likely to be causing the issue, as they handle the logic for how properties are aligned and spaced in code.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the misalignment of JSX objects when using ESLint's 'key-spacing' rule with 'align: value'. The rule causes the code format to become visually unappealing, aligning multi-line object values in a way that is not expected or desired. The provided images illustrate the misalignment issue where style objects in JSX are not aligned properly after running ESLint with 'fix' option."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the 'key-spacing' rule in ESLint, specifically when aligning values in multi-line objects. The key functions involved are those that verify the alignment and spacing of properties in object literals. These functions enforce the formatting rules that are misaligning the JSX styles. Adjusting these functions would be necessary to prevent the undesirable reformatting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the misalignment of key-value pairs in JSX objects when ESLint's 'key-spacing' rule is used with 'align: value'. This results in the style objects within JSX being reformatted in an undesirable way, causing them to look 'ugly'. The images show examples of JSX code where inline styles are improperly aligned after running eslint --fix."
