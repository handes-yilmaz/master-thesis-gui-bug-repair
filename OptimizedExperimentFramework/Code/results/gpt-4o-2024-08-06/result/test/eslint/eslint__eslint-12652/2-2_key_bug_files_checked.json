        "explanation": "The file 'lib/rules/key-spacing.js' is responsible for the 'key-spacing' rule in ESLint, which controls the spacing between keys and values in object literals. The issue described in the bug report is directly related to this rule, particularly with the 'align: value' option, which is causing the misalignment in JSX objects. This file likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle JSX objects correctly without causing the formatting issues shown in the images.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the misalignment of JSX object properties when using ESLint's 'key-spacing' rule with the 'align: value' option. The images show JSX code where the style properties are misaligned after running ESLint with the 'fix' option, leading to an undesirable formatting of the code."
