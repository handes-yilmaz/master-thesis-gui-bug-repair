        "explanation": "The file 'lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js' is related to the 'no-constant-condition' rule in ESLint. This rule is responsible for identifying constant conditions in code, and any modifications needed to address the reported issue with error ranges being too broad would likely occur in this file.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue relates to the 'no-constant-condition' rule in ESLint, which is reporting error ranges that are too broad, encompassing entire statements or expressions instead of just the constant conditions themselves. In the provided example, the condition 'true' is generating errors that include the full 'if' statement and the conditional expression."

        "explanation": "The file 'lib/rules/no-constant-condition.js' is relevant because it contains the implementation of the 'no-constant-condition' rule in ESLint. To correct the bug, modifications in this file might be needed to adjust the reported error range to only include the constant conditions, aligning with what is described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with ESLint's error reporting for the 'no-constant-condition' rule, where the reported error range is too broad. The expectation is that the range should only include the constant condition itself, but currently, the entire statement or expression is marked as erroneous."
