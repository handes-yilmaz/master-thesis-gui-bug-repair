        "explanation": "The issue is related to incorrect indentation handling in JSX expressions with parentheses. The `lib/rules/indent.js` is responsible for managing the indentation rules in ESLint, making it the most likely candidate to contain the logic needing adjustment to resolve this regression bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an indentation issue with JSX binary expressions when using parentheses in ESLint version 4.1.1. Despite the configuration specifying a 4-space indentation, ESLint is erroneously expecting and flagging different indentation levels when parentheses are involved in JSX."

        "bug_files": [
            "lib/rules/indent.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is directly related to how ESLint handles indentation, specifically for JSX binary expressions. The file `lib/rules/indent.js` is responsible for implementing the indentation logic in ESLint, and hence, it is relevant to the bug. Adjustments in this file would be required to resolve the indentation regression problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug is related to regression in indentation handling for JSX binary expressions with parentheses in ESLint 4.1.0. The expected behavior is for no errors to be thrown when parentheses are used, but indentation errors are observed in the given examples. The indentation errors occur when there are parentheses around the JSX element, resulting in unexpected indent check failures."
