            "lib/rules/key-spacing.js//Verifies spacing of property conforms to specified options."
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue lies in the ESLint rule responsible for key spacing and alignment. The functions in 'key-spacing.js' are directly related to the problem because they handle the verification and enforcement of spacing and alignment rules for object literals. The misalignment in JSX objects is likely due to incorrect handling of these rules, particularly for multiline configurations. Adjusting these functions should address the incorrect realignment behavior seen in the bug scenario.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect alignment of JSX objects when using ESLint with the 'key-spacing' rule configured to align values. The images show JSX code where object properties within the style attribute are misaligned after running eslint --fix, which results in an undesirable format."

            "lib/rules/key-spacing.js//Verifies vertical alignment, taking into account groups of properties"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the 'key-spacing' rule in ESLint, specifically when the 'align: value' option is used. This affects the alignment of JSX object properties, which is controlled by the functions responsible for verifying vertical alignment of properties. These functions need to ensure that the alignment rules are applied correctly without causing unwanted re-alignment in JSX context.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when ESLint's 'key-spacing' rule with 'align: value' re-aligns JSX object styles, making them appear misaligned or 'ugly'. This is shown in the images where the alignment of styles inside JSX objects is inconsistent or undesirable after running ESLint with the '--fix' option."
