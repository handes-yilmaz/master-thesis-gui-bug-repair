        "explanation": "The file 'lib/rules/key-spacing.js' is responsible for the 'key-spacing' rule in ESLint, which controls the spacing between keys and values in object literals. The bug report specifically mentions issues with the 'align: value' option in this rule, which is causing the misalignment in JSX objects. This file likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to handle JSX objects correctly without causing the formatting issues described.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the ESLint rule 'key-spacing' with the 'align: value' option causing misalignment in JSX objects. The images show JSX code where the style properties are misaligned after running ESLint with the 'fix' option, leading to an undesirable formatting of the code."
