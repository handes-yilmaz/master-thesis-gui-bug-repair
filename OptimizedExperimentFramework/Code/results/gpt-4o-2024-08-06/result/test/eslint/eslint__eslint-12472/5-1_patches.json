    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report and images indicate an issue with the ESLint rule `key-spacing` when using the `align: 'value'` option. The problem arises when ESLint's `--fix` command is run, causing misalignment in JSX object properties. The expected behavior is to maintain the original alignment of object properties within JSX curlies, but the current implementation sometimes results in an \"ugly\" alignment.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely within the `key-spacing` rule implementation, specifically in how it handles alignment for JSX objects. The relevant code snippet is in `lib/rules/key-spacing.js`, particularly in the `verifyGroupAlignment` function, which manages the alignment of properties.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo address the issue, we need to ensure that the alignment logic correctly handles JSX objects without altering their intended formatting. The patch will adjust the alignment logic to respect the original formatting when `align: 'value'` is specified.\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/key-spacing.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            }\n=======\n            if (alignmentOptions && length > 1) { // When aligning values within a group, use the alignment configuration.\n                beforeColon = alignmentOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = alignmentOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = alignmentOptions.mode;\n            } else {\n                beforeColon = multiLineOptions.beforeColon;\n                afterColon = multiLineOptions.afterColon;\n                mode = multiLineOptions.mode; // Fix: Use multiLineOptions mode for non-aligned cases\n            }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that when the alignment options are not explicitly set, the `multiLineOptions.mode` is used, preventing unintended reformatting of JSX objects."
