        "explanation": "These files define the ESLint rules relevant to the reported bug: `key-spacing` for spacing around keys in object literals, `object-curly-newline` for line breaks in curly braces, `object-property-newline` for property alignment, and `object-curly-spacing` for spacing inside curly braces. Modifying these may help address the misalignment issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The images illustrate an issue where ESLint's `--fix` option misaligns keys and values in JSX objects, leading to cluttered code formatting. This occurs specifically with the `key-spacing` rule set to align by value within a JSX context, causing undesirable re-alignment of objects in JSX curlies."

            "lib/rules/key-spacing.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are relevant to the bug because: 1. `lib/rules/key-spacing.js`: Handles the `key-spacing` rule directly, which is responsible for the misalignment issue. 2. `lib/linter/index.js`: Relates to the application and execution of linter rules on source code. 3. `lib/linter/source-code-fixer.js`: Performs the autofix action which misaligns the style objects.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug depicts the misalignment issue with the ESLint \"key-spacing\" rule when dealing with JSX style objects. The expected alignment isn't respected, causing the code to look 'ugly' after running ESLint fix commands. This is indicated in the before-and-after ESLint fix images where the spacing and alignment in the style objects are distorted."
