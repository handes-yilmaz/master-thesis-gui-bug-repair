        "explanation": "The issue arises from the 'implicit-arrow-linebreak' rule's autofixing logic in ESLint. The key function 'autoFixBesides' in 'implicit-arrow-linebreak.js' is responsible for handling the formatting of arrow functions, which includes managing line breaks and comments. 'validateExpression' is also crucial as it determines when the autofix should be applied based on the rule options. Additionally, 'SourceCodeFixer.applyFixes' in 'source-code-fixer.js' is responsible for applying the fixes generated by the rules, and any error in its logic can lead to incorrect modifications to the code. These functions and modules are directly involved in the bug as they control the formatting and fixing process that is resulting in broken code.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the ESLint autofixer for the 'implicit-arrow-linebreak' rule, which incorrectly adds extra characters, breaking the JavaScript code. This is particularly problematic when comments are present near arrow functions, causing malformed syntax and invalid JavaScript code."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to the autofixing mechanism of the implicit-arrow-linebreak rule. The classes and functions involved in this mechanism, such as `autoFixBesides`, `addParentheses`, and `validateExpression`, are key components of the rule that enforce or fix line breaks in arrow functions. Issues with these functions can lead to improper handling of comments or parentheses, resulting in broken code. Additionally, the `SourceCodeFixer.applyFixes` function is responsible for applying fixes to the source code, and any errors in its logic could contribute to the problem. Fixing these functions should address the incorrect autofixing behavior.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the implicit-arrow-linebreak autofixer in ESLint sometimes adding extra characters, resulting in broken JavaScript code. This occurs when comments are placed inside arrow functions, leading to incorrect formatting and syntax errors after running ESLint with the --fix option."
