        "explanation": "1. **lib/cli-engine/cli-engine.js**: This file is likely responsible for the main operations of the CLI engine, including how formatters are handled. To support async formatters, changes would need to be made here to allow the formatter function to be asynchronous.\n\n2. **lib/cli-engine/formatters/stylish.js**: This file contains the implementation of a specific formatter. To support async operations, the formatter function in this file would need to be modified to handle asynchronous code execution.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves a request to support an asynchronous formatter in ESLint. The current formatter does not support async operations, which is needed for integrating with the 'shiki' highlighter that provides better code highlighting but requires async support."
