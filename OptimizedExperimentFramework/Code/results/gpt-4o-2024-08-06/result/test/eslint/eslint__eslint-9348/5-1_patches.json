    "1/1": "To address the issue of \"Cannot read property 'superCalled' of undefined,\" we need to examine the code in the `lib/rules/no-this-before-super.js` file. The error suggests that the `superCalled` property is being accessed on an undefined object, which likely means that the `segInfoMap` is not being properly initialized or accessed.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\nThe error occurs because the `segInfoMap` is not correctly initialized for all segments, leading to attempts to access `superCalled` on an undefined object. This can happen if the segment is not part of a constructor with an `extends` clause, or if the initialization logic is skipped.\n\n### Bug Fix\nWe need to ensure that `segInfoMap` is properly initialized for all segments that are part of a constructor with an `extends` clause. This involves checking the initialization logic and ensuring that `segInfoMap[segment.id]` is always defined before accessing its properties.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### lib/rules/no-this-before-super.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            onCodePathSegmentStart(segment) {\n                if (!isInConstructorOfDerivedClass()) {\n                    return;\n                }\n\n                // Initialize info.\n                segInfoMap[segment.id] = {\n                    superCalled: (\n                        segment.prevSegments.length > 0 &&\n                        segment.prevSegments.every(isCalled)\n                    ),\n                    invalidNodes: []\n                };\n            },\n=======\n            onCodePathSegmentStart(segment) {\n                // Ensure segInfoMap is initialized for all segments\n                segInfoMap[segment.id] = segInfoMap[segment.id] || {\n                    superCalled: false,\n                    invalidNodes: []\n                };\n\n                if (isInConstructorOfDerivedClass()) {\n                    // Update info if in a constructor of a derived class\n                    segInfoMap[segment.id].superCalled = (\n                        segment.prevSegments.length > 0 &&\n                        segment.prevSegments.every(isCalled)\n                    );\n                }\n            },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that `segInfoMap[segment.id]` is always initialized, preventing the \"Cannot read property 'superCalled' of undefined\" error. The logic for updating `superCalled` is only applied if the segment is part of a constructor of a derived class."
