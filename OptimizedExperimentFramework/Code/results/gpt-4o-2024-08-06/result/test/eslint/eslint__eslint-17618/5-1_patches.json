    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue with the code path analysis for the expression `(a && b) ?? c`. The expected behavior is that there should be a path from `a` to `c` that bypasses `b`, which is not currently represented in the analysis. The image provided shows the current code path analysis, which incorrectly assumes that `b` must be evaluated before `c`.\n\nThe root cause of the issue is likely in the handling of logical expressions within the code path analysis, specifically how the `&&` operator is treated in combination with the `??` operator.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-analyzer.js` file. The function `processCodePathToEnter` handles logical expressions and needs to be adjusted to correctly account for the short-circuiting behavior of `&&` when used with `??`.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### lib/linter/code-path-analysis/code-path-analyzer.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        case \"LogicalExpression\":\n            if (isHandledLogicalOperator(node.operator)) {\n                state.pushChoiceContext(\n                    node.operator,\n                    isForkingByTrueOrFalse(node)\n                );\n            }\n            break;\n=======\n        case \"LogicalExpression\":\n            if (isHandledLogicalOperator(node.operator)) {\n                if (node.operator === \"&&\" && node.parent.operator === \"??\") {\n                    state.pushChoiceContext(\n                        \"??\",\n                        true\n                    );\n                } else {\n                    state.pushChoiceContext(\n                        node.operator,\n                        isForkingByTrueOrFalse(node)\n                    );\n                }\n            }\n            break;\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the handling of `LogicalExpression` nodes to correctly account for the short-circuiting behavior of `&&` when followed by `??`. It ensures that the code path analysis reflects the possibility of bypassing `b` and directly evaluating `c` if `a` is falsy."
