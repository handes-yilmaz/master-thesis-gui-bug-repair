        "explanation": "The issue is related to missing syntax highlighting for certain Bash and shell script elements. The classes and functions in 'src/languages/bash.js' and 'src/languages/shell.js' are responsible for defining the language syntax and highlighting rules. These files would need to be modified to include patterns that recognize and highlight pipes, stream redirections, heredoc markers, and other syntax elements mentioned in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The images show shell and bash scripts where specific syntax elements like pipes, stream redirections, and heredoc markers are not highlighted as expected. This lack of syntax highlighting can make it difficult to read and understand the scripts at a glance."

        "explanation": "The issue lies in the Bash language highlighting implementation, specifically in how different Bash elements are defined and recognized for syntax highlighting. The 'bash.js' file contains the main function responsible for defining language rules and syntax elements like variables, subshells, and strings. Adjustments to this function would be necessary to add missing syntax elements like heredocs and pipes, ensuring they are correctly highlighted in Bash scripts.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves the lack of syntax highlighting for certain Bash script elements in the provided images. Elements like pipes, continue command markers, stream redirections, and subshell variables are not highlighted, which affects readability and understanding of Bash scripts."
