    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue described in the bug report is related to syntax highlighting for the `bash` language. The expected behavior is that certain elements like pipes (`|`), continuation markers (`\\`), stream redirections (`>`, `<`), here-docs (`<<`, `<<<`), and subshell variables (`$(...)`) should be highlighted. The images show that these elements are not being highlighted as expected.\n\nThe root cause is likely that the current syntax definitions in the `bash.js` file do not include rules for highlighting these specific elements.\n\n### Bug Localization\n\nThe relevant file for this issue is `src/languages/bash.js`. This file contains the syntax definitions for the `bash` language. We need to add rules to highlight the missing elements.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we will add new rules to the `bash.js` file to handle the missing syntax elements.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/bash.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const SUBST = {\n    className: 'subst',\n    begin: /\\$\\(/, end: /\\)/,\n    contains: [hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE]\n  };\n  const QUOTE_STRING = {\n    className: 'string',\n    begin: /\"/, end: /\"/,\n    contains: [\n      hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n      VAR,\n      SUBST\n    ]\n  };\n=======\n  const SUBST = {\n    className: 'subst',\n    begin: /\\$\\(/, end: /\\)/,\n    contains: [hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE]\n  };\n  const QUOTE_STRING = {\n    className: 'string',\n    begin: /\"/, end: /\"/,\n    contains: [\n      hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n      VAR,\n      SUBST\n    ]\n  };\n\n  const PIPE = {\n    className: 'operator',\n    begin: /\\|/\n  };\n\n  const REDIRECTION = {\n    className: 'operator',\n    begin: />|<|>>|<<|<>|>&|<&|<>>|<<</\n  };\n\n  const HEREDOC = {\n    className: 'string',\n    begin: /<<-?\\s*(\\w+)\\b/, end: /\\b\\1\\b/,\n    contains: [hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE]\n  };\n\n  const CONTINUATION = {\n    className: 'symbol',\n    begin: /\\\\$/\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **PIPE**: Added a rule to highlight the pipe operator (`|`).\n- **REDIRECTION**: Added a rule to highlight various forms of stream redirections.\n- **HEREDOC**: Added a rule to highlight here-docs, capturing the start and end markers.\n- **CONTINUATION**: Added a rule to highlight the continuation marker (`\\`).\n\nThese changes should ensure that the specified elements are highlighted correctly in `bash` scripts."
