        "explanation": "The issue is related to the incorrect rendering of Handlebars syntax in Glimmer templates, particularly with block `if` and `else` statements. The `OPENING_BLOCK_MUSTACHE_CONTENTS`, `CLOSING_BLOCK_MUSTACHE_CONTENTS`, and `BASIC_MUSTACHE_CONTENTS` functions in `handlebars.js` are responsible for defining how these block statements are parsed and highlighted. Any inconsistencies or errors in these functions could lead to incorrect highlighting, making them key elements to address for this bug.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting of Handlebars templates in Glimmer, specifically affecting block `if` and `else` statements. The expected behavior is that values and keywords should be highlighted distinctly and consistently, which is not currently happening."

        ],
        "explanation": "The `BUILT_INS` array in `handlebars.js` includes the `if` and `else` keywords, which are not being highlighted correctly. The `HELPER_NAME_OR_PATH_EXPRESSION` and its usage in `OPENING_BLOCK_MUSTACHE_CONTENTS` and `CLOSING_BLOCK_MUSTACHE_CONTENTS` control how block statements and mustaches are parsed and highlighted. These elements are crucial for correct syntax highlighting in Handlebars, especially for conditional blocks.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a block `if` statement in Handlebars that is rendering incorrectly. The issue is with the syntax highlighting where values and keywords are not highlighted distinctly or consistently. This problem is apparent in Glimmer templates using Handlebars, causing confusion in reading and understanding the template structure."
