    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the Handlebars syntax highlighting correctly distinguishes between keywords and values, especially in `if` and `else` blocks. The problem seems to be related to how the `else if` condition is being parsed and highlighted.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image and bug report indicate that the `else if` block is not being highlighted correctly. The expected behavior is for keywords like `if`, `else`, and `else if` to be highlighted distinctly from values and other expressions.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the provided `handlebars.js` file, the relevant section for handling `else` blocks is:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  className: 'template-tag',\n  begin: /\\\\{\\\\{(?=else\\\\}\\\\})/,\n  end: /\\\\}\\\\}/,\n  keywords: 'else'\n}\n```\n\nThis regex only matches `{{else}}` and does not account for `{{else if condition}}`. We need to modify this to handle `else if` conditions properly.\n\n### Patch\n\nWe will update the regex to include `else if` conditions and ensure that the keywords are highlighted correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/handlebars.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n{\n  className: 'template-tag',\n  begin: /\\\\{\\\\{(?=else\\\\}\\\\})/,\n  end: /\\\\}\\\\}/,\n  keywords: 'else'\n}\n=======\n{\n  className: 'template-tag',\n  begin: /\\\\{\\\\{(?=else(\\\\s+if\\\\s+[^\\\\}]+)?\\\\}\\\\})/,\n  end: /\\\\}\\\\}/,\n  keywords: 'else if'\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Regex Update**: The `begin` regex is updated to match `{{else if condition}}` by allowing for an optional `if` condition after `else`.\n- **Keywords Update**: The `keywords` field is updated to include both `else` and `if` to ensure proper highlighting.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by correctly highlighting `else if` conditions in Handlebars templates."
