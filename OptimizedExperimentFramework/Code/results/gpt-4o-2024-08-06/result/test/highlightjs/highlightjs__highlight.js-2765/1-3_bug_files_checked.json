        "explanation": "The files `handlebars.js` and `htmlbars.js` under `src/languages/lib/` are relevant to the bug because they define the syntax highlighting rules for Handlebars templates. Since the problem reported is about improper highlighting of syntax in Handlebars, modifying these files to enhance or correct the syntax definition could address the issue and implement consistent and distinct highlighting for values and keywords.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue relates to syntactic highlighting in Handlebars (hbs) for code using block `if` statements, where proper highlighting is not applied to values and keywords, causing inconsistency. The provided code snippet showcases improper rendering of syntax on a blog, where values and keywords appear in red without distinction."

        "bug_files": [

            "src/languages/htmlbars.js",
            "src/lib/modes.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "1. `src/languages/lib/handlebars.js`: This file likely contains the syntax highlighting rules for Handlebars, including how block `if` statements and other constructs are rendered. Correcting the highlighting logic here would directly address the rendering bug.\n2. `src/languages/lib/htmlbars.js`: As Handlebars is closely related to Glimmer and Ember, `htmlbars.js` may include related syntax definitions or parsing logic pertinent to the issue.\n3. `src/lib/modes.js`: This file might handle the mode and parsing strategy for different languages, including decisions on how Handlebars syntax elements are interpreted during highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The Handlebars syntax for block `if` statements is not highlighted correctly in the given example. The image shows that `if` is highlighted inconsistently, and logical conditions and values are indistinguishable. This affects readability and clarity of the syntax, making it harder to distinguish between keywords and values."
