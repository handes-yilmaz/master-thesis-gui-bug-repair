    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is with the syntax highlighting of Ruby heredocs without interpolation. In Ruby, heredocs can be defined with or without interpolation. The problem arises when heredocs are defined without interpolation using `<<-'MESSAGE'`. The ending of such heredocs is not being highlighted correctly, as seen in the provided image.\n\nThe root cause is likely in the regex pattern used to detect heredocs in the syntax highlighting configuration. The pattern may not correctly handle heredocs that use single quotes to disable interpolation.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in `src/languages/ruby.js`. The regex pattern for heredocs is defined in the `STRING` object. The current pattern does not correctly handle heredocs without interpolation.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to adjust the regex pattern to correctly identify heredocs without interpolation.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/ruby.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      { // heredocs\n        begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?(\\\\w+)\\\\n(?:[^\\\\n]*\\\\n)*?\\\\s*\\\\1\\\\b/,\n        returnBegin: true,\n        contains: [\n          {\n            begin: /<<[-~]?\\'?/\n          },\n          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({\n            begin: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            end: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            contains: [\n              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n              SUBST\n            ]\n          })\n        ]\n      }\n=======\n      { // heredocs\n        begin: /<<[-~]?'?(\\\\w+)'?\\\\n(?:[^\\\\n]*\\\\n)*?\\\\s*\\\\1\\\\b/,\n        returnBegin: true,\n        contains: [\n          {\n            begin: /<<[-~]?'?/\n          },\n          hljs.END_SAME_AS_BEGIN({\n            begin: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            end: /(\\\\w+)/,\n            contains: [\n              hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE,\n              SUBST\n            ]\n          })\n        ]\n      }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the regex pattern to correctly handle heredocs without interpolation by ensuring that the single quote is optional both at the beginning and end of the heredoc identifier."
