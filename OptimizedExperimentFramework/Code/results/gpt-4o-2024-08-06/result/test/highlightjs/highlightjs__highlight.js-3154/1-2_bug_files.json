        "explanation": "The issue is related to syntax highlighting for Ruby, specifically for heredocs. The file likely responsible for handling Ruby syntax highlighting is `src/languages/ruby.js`, as this would contain the logic for parsing and highlighting Ruby syntax, including heredoc handling. Fixing or enhancing the logic in this file should address the problem with correct highlighting for heredocs without interpolation.",
        "bug_scenario": "When using Ruby heredocs without interpolation, the closing delimiter is not highlighted correctly. The issue is visible in the screenshot where the heredoc with double quotes is highlighted, but the heredoc with single quotes (indicating no interpolation) is not highlighted properly."

        "explanation": "The problem is specific to the handling of Ruby's heredoc syntax. Since this issue is with syntax highlighting, it is likely managed within the file responsible for Ruby language support, which is `src/languages/ruby.js`. Modifying this file would involve adjusting the regex or logic used to detect and highlight heredocs correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is related to the incorrect syntax highlighting of Ruby heredocs without interpolation. Unlike standard heredocs, these use different delimiters and are not being highlighted properly in the code editor. The expected behavior is for the entire heredoc, including its ending, to be highlighted as a string."
