        "explanation": "1. **src/languages/scala.js**: This file likely contains the syntax definitions and rules for rendering Scala code. The issue with Scala comments appearing as titles suggests a problem in how comments are parsed.\n2. **src/languages/javascript.js**: This file is responsible for the syntax highlighting for Javascript. The problem with comments inside function parameters not being recognized suggests a need to review how Javascript syntax and comments are parsed and highlighted.\n3. **src/lib/html_renderer.js**: This file might handle how the parsed code is converted to HTML/CSS for viewing. Adjustments here could correct how elements including comments are displayed after parsing.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes two main issues with syntax highlighting using Highlight.js version 9.12.0. For Scala, comments are incorrectly rendered as class titles when the opening curly bracket is on a new line. For Javascript, comments inside function parameters are not highlighted at all, as seen in the provided image where comments are not highlighted among parameters."

        "explanation": "The issues reported involve syntax highlighting problems with Scala and JavaScript code. The likely files responsible for these issues are `scala.js` and `javascript.js` in the `src/languages/` directory, as these files would contain the logic for highlighting syntax specific to these languages. Fixing the highlighting issues will involve reviewing and possibly modifying these files to ensure that comments are correctly identified and rendered in both scenarios.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes two issues related to syntax highlighting using Highlight.js version 9.12.0. The first issue occurs in Scala, where comments are incorrectly rendered as class titles when the class definition and comments are on separate lines. The second issue is with JavaScript, where comments inside function parameters are not highlighted correctly. The provided image demonstrates the issue with JavaScript comments not being highlighted when they are inside function parameters."
