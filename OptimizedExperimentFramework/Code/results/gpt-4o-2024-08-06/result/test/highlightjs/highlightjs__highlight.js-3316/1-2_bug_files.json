        "explanation": "The files 'cpp.js' and 'arduino.js' in the 'src/languages/' directory are likely responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for C++ and its derivatives. These files would contain the logic for classifying and highlighting keywords and primitive types. Modifications to these files would be needed to revert to the old behavior where primitive types are highlighted as keywords, as described in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report discusses a change made in hljs version 11.0.0 where primitive types in C++ were separated from keywords for highlighting purposes. This change caused primitive types not to be highlighted as keywords, which is different from the behavior of many popular IDEs and editors. The attached images show the difference between the old and new syntax highlighting styles. The images illustrate how regaining previous behavior, where primitive types are highlighted as keywords, might be preferred by some users."

        ],
        "explanation": "The bug is related to the syntax highlighting for C++ and Arduino code, specifically how keywords and primitive types are categorized. The repository contains language definition files for both C++ (`src/languages/cpp.js`) and Arduino (`src/languages/arduino.js`). These files would likely need to be modified to address the highlighting changes and restore the behavior where primitive types are treated as keywords, aligning with user expectations and standard practices.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report describes an issue with syntax highlighting in C++ code after an update to the highlighting library. Initially, primitive types (e.g., `int`, `char`) were highlighted as keywords, but the update changed this behavior, leading to less intuitive highlighting for some users. The images depict the difference in highlighting styles across different scenarios, both before and after the change, and in various IDEs."
