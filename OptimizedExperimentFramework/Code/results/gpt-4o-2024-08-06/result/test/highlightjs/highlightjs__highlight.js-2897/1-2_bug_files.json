        "explanation": "This bug is likely related to how comments are parsed in JavaScript and TypeScript files. The files `ecmascript.js`, `javascript.js`, and `typescript.js` in `src/languages/lib/` are responsible for defining the syntax and rules for these languages, making them potential locations where block comments might be incorrectly handled, thus leading to the highlighted issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is with syntax highlighting for JavaScript and TypeScript. Specifically, an empty block comment like `/**/console.log(\"Hello, World!\")/**/` breaks the highlighting process."

        "explanation": "The `ecmascript.js`, `javascript.js`, and `typescript.js` in the `src/languages/` directory are likely responsible for defining the syntax rules and highlighting configurations for JavaScript and TypeScript. Since the issue is related to how comments are parsed in these languages, these are the files where changes might be necessary. The `highlight.js` file in `src/lib/` is also relevant as it likely contains the core logic for the syntax highlighting feature, thus changes could be needed to handle specific edge cases with comments correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue involves the syntax highlighting breaking when an empty block comment is used in JavaScript or TypeScript code along with the `highlight` method. The provided sample code `/**/console.log(\"Hello, World!\")/**/` is causing the highlighting to incorrectly interpret the comments and code, which affects the display as shown in the images."
