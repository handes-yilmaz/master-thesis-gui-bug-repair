        "explanation": "The file `src/languages/elixir.js` is responsible for Elixir syntax highlighting. The issue described is specific to how Elixir code is highlighted, particularly around the function capture syntax using `&/`. This file likely contains the logic that needs to be adjusted to correctly interpret the `/` in the context of function capturing, ensuring proper highlighting throughout the code snippet.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect code highlighting in Elixir, specifically when using function capture syntax (`&function_name/arity`). The `highlight` function treats slashes `/` incorrectly, leading to improper syntax coloring after the capture syntax. This is noticeable in the screenshots where portions of the code are incorrectly highlighted due to the misinterpretation of `/` in `&letter?/1`."

        "explanation": "The problem is related to syntax highlighting for Elixir code, specifically with the handling of function captures. The file `elixir.js` in `src/languages/` is likely responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for Elixir, making it directly related to the bug and needing adjustments to handle function captures correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when highlighting Elixir code, specifically with function captures using the syntax `&function_name/arity`. The slash `/` seems to confuse the syntax highlighter, causing incorrect highlighting for the rest of the code. The expected behavior is for the code to remain uniformly highlighted, but introducing the function capture disrupts the color scheme."
