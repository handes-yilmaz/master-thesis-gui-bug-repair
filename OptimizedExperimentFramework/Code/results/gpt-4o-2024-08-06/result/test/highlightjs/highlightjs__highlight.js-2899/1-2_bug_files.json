        "explanation": "The issue involves Dart syntax highlighting. The file `src/languages/dart.js` likely contains the logic for Dart language syntax rules and highlighting. Editing this file will help to correct the syntax highlighting problem when comments are used as shown in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is with the 'highlight' feature not displaying code correctly in Dart when an empty block-comment is used. This issue is highlighted in the images from the bug report, showing incorrect syntax highlighting when using a comment in Dart with the code `/**/main(){print(\"Hello, World!\");}/**/`. The expected behavior shows how it should appear correctly, but it's breaking the highlighting further."

        "explanation": "The bug is specific to Dart language syntax highlighting. Thus, the Dart language definition file `src/languages/dart.js` is the primary suspect where modifications might be needed to handle empty block comments correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue reported is related to Dart syntax highlighting, where an empty block comment at the beginning of the code breaks further syntax highlighting. This is demonstrated with a simple Dart program `/**/main(){print(\"Hello, World!\");}/**/` which does not highlight correctly when using the highlight library."
