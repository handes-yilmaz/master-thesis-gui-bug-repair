    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is with Dart syntax highlighting when using empty block comments (`/**/`). The highlighting breaks, as shown in the images, when such comments are used. The expected behavior is that the code should be highlighted correctly even with empty block comments.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe problem likely lies in the Dart language definition for syntax highlighting, specifically in how comments are handled. The `hljs.COMMENT` function is used to define comment patterns, but it seems that empty block comments are not being handled correctly.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure that empty block comments are correctly recognized and do not break the highlighting. We can adjust the comment handling to account for this.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/dart.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      hljs.C_BLOCK_COMMENT_MODE,\n=======\n      hljs.COMMENT(\n        '/\\\\*\\\\*?/',\n        '\\\\*/',\n        {\n          relevance: 0\n        }\n      ),\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the handling of block comments to correctly recognize and handle empty block comments (`/**/`). The `relevance: 0` ensures that these comments do not affect the relevance scoring of the syntax highlighting."
