        "explanation": "The issue is related to the syntax highlighting of PHP variables. In the `src/languages/php.js` file, the `VARIABLE` and `SUBST` objects define the regex patterns for recognizing PHP variables. The `function(hljs)` is responsible for returning the language configuration, including how variables should be highlighted. Adjusting these elements should resolve the variable highlighting issue.",

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the syntax highlighting rules for PHP in the `php.js` file. The `VARIABLE` rule defines how PHP variables are recognized and highlighted. Since PHP variables are not being highlighted, this rule is likely not functioning correctly or is missing the appropriate logic to apply the correct styling. Adjusting the `VARIABLE` definition should address the highlighting issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves PHP variables not being highlighted in code snippets, leading to unreadable code. The expected behavior is that PHP variables like `$response` should be highlighted."
