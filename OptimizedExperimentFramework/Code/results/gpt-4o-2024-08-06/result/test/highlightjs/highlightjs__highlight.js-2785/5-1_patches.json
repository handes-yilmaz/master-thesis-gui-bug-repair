    "1/1": "To address the issue of PHP variables not being highlighted, we need to ensure that the PHP language definition correctly identifies and highlights variables. The bug report indicates that PHP variables should be highlighted as `variable`.\n\n### Bug Scenario Images Description and Reasoning\n\nThe images show PHP code where variables are not highlighted, making the code less readable. The expected behavior is that PHP variables should be highlighted to improve readability.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nIn the provided `php.js` file, the `VARIABLE` pattern is defined but not assigned a `className`. This is likely why variables are not being highlighted. We need to add a `className` to the `VARIABLE` pattern to ensure it is recognized and highlighted correctly.\n\n### Patch\n\nHere is the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/php.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  var VARIABLE = {\n    begin: '\\\\$+[a-zA-Z_\\\\x7f-\\\\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\\\\x7f-\\\\xff]*'\n  };\n=======\n  var VARIABLE = {\n    className: 'variable',\n    begin: '\\\\$+[a-zA-Z_\\\\x7f-\\\\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\\\\x7f-\\\\xff]*'\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch adds the `className: 'variable'` to the `VARIABLE` pattern, ensuring that PHP variables are highlighted correctly."
