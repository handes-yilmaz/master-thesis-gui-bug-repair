        "explanation": "The highlighting issue for PHP variables suggests a problem in the syntax highlighting logic for PHP. The `src/languages/php.js` file is likely responsible for defining how PHP code is highlighted and thus would need modifications to correctly identify and style PHP variables.",
        "bug_scenario": "PHP variables are not highlighted as expected. In the actual behavior image, variables like `$response` are not distinct in color. In the expected behavior image, variables should be colored differently for clarity."

            "src/languages/php-template.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The files likely responsible for handling PHP syntax highlighting are `php.js` and `php-template.js`. These files would contain the logic for recognizing and styling PHP code elements, including variables. Since the bug is about PHP variables not being highlighted, changes would need to be made here to ensure variables are parsed and highlighted correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is that PHP variables are not highlighted, leading to unreadable code snippets. The expected behavior shows PHP variables highlighted in a distinct color, whereas in the actual behavior, they are not highlighted, making the code difficult to read."
