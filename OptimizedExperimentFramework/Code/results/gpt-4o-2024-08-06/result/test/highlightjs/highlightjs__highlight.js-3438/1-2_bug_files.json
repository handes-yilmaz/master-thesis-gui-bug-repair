        "explanation": "The bug is related to the rendering of C++ code using the syntax highlighter. The file `src/languages/cpp.js` is responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for C++, which might contain errors or missing rules causing the issue. Additionally, `src/highlight.js` is the core file responsible for the highlighting process, and it might require changes to handle specific C++ syntax correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue involves the inability to render some C++ code properly, which is evident from the provided images. In the first image, we see that certain parts of the code are not being rendered correctly compared to the second image, which shows the expected behavior."

        ],
        "explanation": "The file 'src/languages/cpp.js' is likely responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for C++. If C++ specific code isn't rendered correctly, errors or omissions in this file could be the cause. Additionally, 'src/highlight.js' might be involved since it includes the code highlighting function. Incorrect configurations or bugs here could also lead to improper rendering.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect rendering of C++ code. The code rendering is missing proper highlighting for the C++ language specifics, such as types, and keywords, which is evident in the images provided showing the same code block highlighted differently."
