    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the CSS highlighting correctly handles strings within parentheses, especially when they contain `)` characters. The problem seems to be that the `)` character is being prioritized incorrectly, causing the string to be improperly highlighted.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image shows CSS variables with URLs that include parentheses in their paths. The issue arises when the highlighter incorrectly interprets the `)` character as the end of a URL or string, rather than part of the string itself.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe relevant code snippet in `src/languages/css.js` is:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  begin: /(url|data-uri)\\(/,\n  end: /\\)/,\n  relevance: 0,\n  keywords: { built_in: \"url data-uri\" },\n  contains: [\n    {\n      className: \"string\",\n      begin: /[^)]/,\n      endsWithParent: true,\n      excludeEnd: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis section is responsible for handling URLs and data URIs. The `begin: /[^)]/` line is intended to capture the content within the parentheses, but it doesn't account for nested parentheses or strings that contain `)`.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle strings within URLs, ensuring that the `)` character inside strings does not prematurely end the URL.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/css.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n{\n  begin: /(url|data-uri)\\(/,\n  end: /\\)/,\n  relevance: 0,\n  keywords: { built_in: \"url data-uri\" },\n  contains: [\n    {\n      className: \"string\",\n      begin: /[^)]/,\n      endsWithParent: true,\n      excludeEnd: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n=======\n{\n  begin: /(url|data-uri)\\(/,\n  end: /\\)/,\n  relevance: 0,\n  keywords: { built_in: \"url data-uri\" },\n  contains: [\n    {\n      className: \"string\",\n      begin: /['\"]/,\n      end: /['\"]/,\n      contains: [hljs.BACKSLASH_ESCAPE]\n    },\n    {\n      className: \"string\",\n      begin: /[^()]+/,\n      endsWithParent: true,\n      excludeEnd: true\n    }\n  ]\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **String Handling**: The patch introduces a more robust handling of strings within URLs by explicitly looking for strings that start and end with quotes (`'` or `\"`). This ensures that any `)` within a quoted string does not terminate the URL prematurely.\n- **Non-String Content**: For content that is not within quotes, the pattern `/[^()]+/` is used to capture everything until a closing parenthesis, ensuring that nested parentheses are handled correctly.\n\nThis patch should resolve the issue by correctly highlighting CSS strings within URLs, even when they contain parentheses."
