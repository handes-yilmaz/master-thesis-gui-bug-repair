        "explanation": "The file 'kotlin.js' in the 'src/languages/' directory is likely responsible for handling syntax highlighting for Kotlin. This should contain the logic for how Kotlin syntax is parsed and displayed, including how brackets are highlighted. Since the issue involves color discrepancies specifically in Kotlin class inheritance, adjustments or fixes are needed in this file to make sure brackets are consistently colored.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a coding error where brackets are highlighted with different colors in class inheritance context within Kotlin code. The issue is prominent in the VSCode markdown preview and has been reproduced on JSFiddle. The expected behavior is for all brackets to be highlighted with the same color, ensuring consistency in syntax highlighting."
