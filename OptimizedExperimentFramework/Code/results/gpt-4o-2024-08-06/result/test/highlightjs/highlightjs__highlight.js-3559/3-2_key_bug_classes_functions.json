        "explanation": "The bug relates to syntax highlighting in Kotlin, specifically with how brackets are colored in class inheritance contexts. The relevant classes and functions in the compressed bug files, such as 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE' and 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE2', are responsible for defining the syntax highlighting rules for parentheses and bracket types. These need to be examined and possibly modified to ensure consistent color highlighting for brackets in inheritance contexts.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue involves brackets in the class inheritance context in Kotlin being highlighted with different colors. This occurs in VSCode markdown preview and is reproducible in JSFiddle."

        "explanation": "The issue relates to how brackets are highlighted in Kotlin code, specifically in class inheritance. The problem likely stems from the syntax highlighting rules defined for Kotlin in the 'kotlin.js' file. The 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE' and 'KOTLIN_PAREN_TYPE2' classes are responsible for handling the syntax highlighting of parentheses, which includes brackets in Kotlin. These classes define variants that manage how brackets are recognized and highlighted. The default function exports the language definitions and contains the logic that combines these components to apply the syntax highlighting rules. Adjustments may be needed in these areas to ensure that brackets are highlighted consistently.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves highlighting issues in Kotlin code, where brackets are displayed in different colors in a class inheritance context. The expected behavior is for the brackets to have the same color, indicating consistency and correct syntax highlighting in the editor."
