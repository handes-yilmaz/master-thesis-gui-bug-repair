        "explanation": "The issue arises from how comments and decorators are parsed and highlighted. In `src/languages/python.js`, the main function defining Python syntax highlighting needs to handle decorators and comments on the same line correctly. In `src/lib/modes.js`, the `COMMENT` and `HASH_COMMENT_MODE` functions are responsible for defining how comments are recognized and highlighted, which is directly related to the bug where comments are not being formatted as expected when decorators are present.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting in Python code where comments on the same line as decorators are not formatted properly. The entire line gets classified as 'hljs-meta' instead of having the comment section as 'hljs-comment'. This results in inconsistent comment formatting when decorators are present."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue stems from how the Python language syntax is defined in the `src/languages/python.js` file. The `export default function` in this file is responsible for defining the language rules, including how decorators and comments are handled. The `COMMENT` and `HASH_COMMENT_MODE` functions in `src/lib/modes.js` are related to how comments are identified and highlighted, and likely need adjustment to correctly apply the `hljs-comment` class to comments following decorators.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves a syntax highlighting issue where a comment on the same line as a decorator in Python code is incorrectly styled as `hljs-meta` instead of `hljs-comment`. This affects the visual representation of comments in code, making it unclear and inconsistent with expected behavior."
