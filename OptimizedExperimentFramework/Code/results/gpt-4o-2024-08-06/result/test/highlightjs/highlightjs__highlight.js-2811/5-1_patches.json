    "1/1": "### Bug Description and Root Cause\n\nThe issue described in the bug report is related to syntax highlighting in Python code, specifically when a comment is placed on the same line as a decorator. The expected behavior is that the comment should be highlighted as a comment (`hljs-comment`), but instead, the entire line is being highlighted as metadata (`hljs-meta`).\n\nThe root cause of this issue is likely in the syntax highlighting rules for Python, where the decorator line is being matched entirely as metadata without properly recognizing and separating the comment part.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe relevant code for syntax highlighting is found in the `src/languages/python.js` file. The section that deals with decorators is:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  className: 'meta',\n  begin: /^[\\t ]*@/, end: /$/\n}\n```\n\nThis rule matches any line starting with `@` as metadata, but it does not account for comments that may follow on the same line.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the rule to allow comments to be recognized separately on the same line as a decorator. We can achieve this by adjusting the `end` pattern to stop at a comment if one is present.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n{\n  className: 'meta',\n  begin: /^[\\t ]*@/, end: /$/\n}\n=======\n{\n  className: 'meta',\n  begin: /^[\\t ]*@/, \n  end: /(?=#)|$/\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change modifies the `end` pattern to stop at a `#` character, allowing the comment to be highlighted separately as a comment. This should resolve the issue of incorrect syntax highlighting for comments on the same line as decorators."
