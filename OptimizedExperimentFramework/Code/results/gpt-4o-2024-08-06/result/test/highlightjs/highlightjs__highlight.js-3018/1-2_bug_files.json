        "explanation": "The bug is related to the incorrect highlighting of `BigInt` in the EcmaScript and JavaScript files. The file `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` likely contains the necessary language definitions for EcmaScript, which directly influences the syntax highlighting rules applied to JavaScript code. Similarly, `src/languages/javascript.js` might handle specific language handling related to JavaScript highlighting and thus should correctly classify `BigInt` and related types like `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array`. These files would be crucial to update in order to ensure that `BigInt` is properly recognized as a built-in type, fixing the issue mentioned in the bug report.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the provided scenario, the `BigInt` type in JavaScript is not being recognized and highlighted as expected in the code editor or tool, although `Number` and other standard types are correctly recognized. This issue is causing the `BigInt` type to appear unformatted or as plain text, even though it is a built-in JavaScript type."

        "explanation": "The issue pertains to syntax highlighting in ECMAScript and JavaScript, where the `BigInt` type along with `BigInt64Array` and `BigUint64Array` are not being recognized as built-in types. The relevant files for resolving this issue likely include `ecmascript.js` and `javascript.js`, as these would define how syntax elements in these languages are identified and highlighted.",
        "bug_scenario": "The scenario shows that `BigInt` is not being recognized as a built-in type in the syntax highlighter. In the images, 'BigInt' lacks the styling that identifies it as a built-in type, unlike other JavaScript types such as `Number`."
