    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Images and Root Cause\n\nThe images show a code snippet where `BigInt` is not highlighted as a type, unlike other types such as `Number`. The issue is that `BigInt` is missing from the list of recognized types in the syntax highlighting configuration for ECMAScript/JavaScript.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe bug is located in the `src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js` file. The `TYPES` array, which contains recognized types for syntax highlighting, does not include `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, or `BigUint64Array`.\n\n### Patch\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to add `BigInt`, `BigInt64Array`, and `BigUint64Array` to the `TYPES` array.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/lib/ecmascript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  \"ArrayBuffer\"\n=======\n  \"ArrayBuffer\",\n  \"BigInt\",\n  \"BigInt64Array\",\n  \"BigUint64Array\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```"
