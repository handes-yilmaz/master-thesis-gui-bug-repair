    "1/1": "To address the issue of incorrect highlighting of double hyphen flags in PowerShell, we need to modify the regular expression responsible for recognizing flags in the `src/languages/powershell.js` file. The current implementation only recognizes single hyphen flags, which is why double hyphen flags are not highlighted correctly.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Images Description:**\n   - The first image shows a PowerShell command with both single and double hyphen flags. The double hyphen flag (`--bar`) is not highlighted, while the single hyphen flag (`-bar`) is highlighted.\n   - The second image shows the code responsible for syntax highlighting. The HTML and JavaScript sections are visible, indicating the setup for highlighting PowerShell code.\n\n2. **Bug Root Cause:**\n   - The issue arises because the regular expression used to identify flags in PowerShell does not account for double hyphen flags. The regex needs to be updated to include both single and double hyphen flags.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\n- **File:** `src/languages/powershell.js`\n  - The relevant section is the `PS_ARGUMENTS` constant, which defines the regex for recognizing flags. It currently only matches single hyphen flags.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to update the regex in the `PS_ARGUMENTS` constant to recognize both single and double hyphen flags.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/powershell.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const PS_ARGUMENTS = {\n    variants: [\n      // PS literals are pretty verbose so it's a good idea to accent them a bit.\n      {\n        className: 'operator',\n        begin: '('.concat(COMPARISON_OPERATORS, ')\\\\b')\n      },\n      {\n        className: 'literal',\n        begin: /(-)[\\w\\d]+/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n=======\n  const PS_ARGUMENTS = {\n    variants: [\n      // PS literals are pretty verbose so it's a good idea to accent them a bit.\n      {\n        className: 'operator',\n        begin: '('.concat(COMPARISON_OPERATORS, ')\\\\b')\n      },\n      {\n        className: 'literal',\n        begin: /(--?)[\\w\\d]+/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Change Made:** Updated the regex in the `PS_ARGUMENTS` constant to `/(--?)[\\w\\d]+/`, which matches both single (`-`) and double (`--`) hyphen flags.\n- **Reasoning:** This change ensures that both types of flags are recognized and highlighted correctly in PowerShell scripts."
