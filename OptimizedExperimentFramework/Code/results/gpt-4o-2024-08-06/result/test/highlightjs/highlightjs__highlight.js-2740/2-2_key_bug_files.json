        "explanation": "1. **src/languages/sql.js**: This file contains the SQL language definition for highlight.js. The issue likely stems from how string escape sequences are handled within this language definition, causing incorrect highlighting.\n\n2. **src/highlight.js**: This file is the core of the highlight.js library, responsible for applying syntax highlighting. It may need adjustments to handle escape sequences correctly across different languages, including SQL.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the highlight.js library incorrectly handling SQL string escape sequences, particularly when using dynamic SQL with escape sequences in T-SQL code. The issue arises when highlighting code blocks, causing incorrect syntax highlighting after a string escape sequence."
