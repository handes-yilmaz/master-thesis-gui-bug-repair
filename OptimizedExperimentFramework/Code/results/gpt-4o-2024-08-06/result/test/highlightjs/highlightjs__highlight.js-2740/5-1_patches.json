    "1/1": "To address the issue with SQL highlighting breaking on quote escape sequences, we need to modify the SQL language definition in the `highlight.js` library. The problem arises because the current implementation does not correctly handle nested or escaped quotes within SQL strings.\n\n### Bug Scenario Image Description and Root Cause\nThe image shows a code editor with SQL code that includes dynamic SQL statements. The issue is that the syntax highlighting breaks after encountering an escape sequence within a string. This is likely due to the highlighter not correctly handling nested or escaped quotes, causing it to misinterpret the end of the string.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\nThe bug is located in the `src/languages/sql.js` file, specifically in the string handling logic. We need to ensure that the highlighter correctly processes escaped quotes within strings.\n\n### Patch\nHere's the patch to fix the issue:\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/sql.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '\\'', end: '\\'',\n            contains: [{begin: '\\'\\''}]\n          },\n=======\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '\\'',\n            end: '\\'',\n            contains: [{begin: '\\'\\''}],\n            relevance: 0\n          },\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '\"',\n            end: '\"',\n            contains: [{begin: '\"\"'}],\n            relevance: 0\n          },\n          {\n            className: 'string',\n            begin: '`',\n            end: '`',\n            relevance: 0\n          },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Relevance Adjustment**: The `relevance: 0` is added to prevent the highlighter from overemphasizing string matches, which can interfere with other language features.\n- **String Handling**: The patch ensures that the highlighter correctly processes both single and double-quoted strings, including handling escaped quotes within them.\n\nThis should resolve the issue with SQL syntax highlighting breaking on quote escape sequences."
