    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is with syntax highlighting in Python code where part of an identifier (`_undef`) is incorrectly highlighted as a keyword (`def`). This happens because the highlighter is mistakenly recognizing the `def` part of `_undef` as the `def` keyword.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe problem likely lies in the way keywords are matched in the syntax highlighting logic. Specifically, the regex pattern used to identify keywords might be too permissive, allowing partial matches within identifiers.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that keywords are only matched when they are standalone and not part of a larger identifier. This can be achieved by adjusting the regex pattern for keywords to ensure they are matched as whole words.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst KEYWORDS = {\n  $pattern: /[A-Za-z]\\w+|__\\w+__/,\n  keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,\n  built_in: BUILT_INS,\n  literal: LITERALS,\n  type: TYPES\n};\n=======\nconst KEYWORDS = {\n  $pattern: /\\b[A-Za-z]\\w*\\b|__\\w+__/,\n  keyword: RESERVED_WORDS,\n  built_in: BUILT_INS,\n  literal: LITERALS,\n  type: TYPES\n};\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Search Block**: The original pattern `/[A-Za-z]\\w+|__\\w+__/` allows for partial matches within identifiers.\n- **Replace Block**: The updated pattern `/\\b[A-Za-z]\\w*\\b|__\\w+__/` ensures that keywords are matched as whole words by using word boundaries (`\\b`). This prevents partial matches within identifiers like `_undef`."
