    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Images and Root Cause\n\nThe images show Python code where keywords directly follow numbers without spaces, such as `1if` and `0else`. The issue is that the syntax highlighting does not correctly separate the number from the keyword, leading to incorrect highlighting.\n\n### Bug Root Cause\n\nThe root cause is that the current syntax highlighting logic does not account for the possibility of keywords directly following numbers without spaces. The highlighting should be able to distinguish between numbers and keywords even when they are adjacent.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue is likely in the `NUMBER` and `KEYWORDS` handling within the `src/languages/python.js` file. We need to adjust the regex patterns or logic to ensure that numbers and keywords are correctly separated and highlighted.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/python.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    relevance: 0,\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: `(\\\\b(${digitpart})|(${pointfloat}))[eE][+-]?(${digitpart})[jJ]?\\\\b`\n      },\n      {\n        begin: `(${pointfloat})[jJ]?`\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b([1-9](_?[0-9])*|0+(_?0)*)[lLjJ]?\\\\b'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[bB](_?[01])+[lL]?\\\\b'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[oO](_?[0-7])+[lL]?\\\\b'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[xX](_?[0-9a-fA-F])+[lL]?\\\\b'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: `\\\\b(${digitpart})[jJ]\\\\b`\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n=======\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    relevance: 0,\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: `(\\\\b(${digitpart})|(${pointfloat}))[eE][+-]?(${digitpart})[jJ]?\\\\b(?!\\\\w)`\n      },\n      {\n        begin: `(${pointfloat})[jJ]?(?!\\\\w)`\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b([1-9](_?[0-9])*|0+(_?0)*)[lLjJ]?\\\\b(?!\\\\w)'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[bB](_?[01])+[lL]?\\\\b(?!\\\\w)'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[oO](_?[0-7])+[lL]?\\\\b(?!\\\\w)'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: '\\\\b0[xX](_?[0-9a-fA-F])+[lL]?\\\\b(?!\\\\w)'\n      },\n      {\n        begin: `\\\\b(${digitpart})[jJ]\\\\b(?!\\\\w)`\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe patch adds `(?!\\\\w)` to the end of each regex pattern in the `NUMBER` variants. This negative lookahead ensures that a number is not immediately followed by a word character, effectively separating numbers from keywords that follow directly."
