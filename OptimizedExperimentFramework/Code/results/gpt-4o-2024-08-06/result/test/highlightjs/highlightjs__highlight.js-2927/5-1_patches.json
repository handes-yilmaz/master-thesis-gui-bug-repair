    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe issue is with the incorrect syntax highlighting of the `LL` suffix in C/C++ integer literals. The problem is that only the first `L` is highlighted, which is incorrect. Both `L`s should be highlighted to properly represent the `long long` integer type in C/C++.\n\n### Bug Analysis and Location\n\nThe bug is likely in the syntax highlighting rules for C and C++ in the `c.js` and `cpp.js` files. These files import a common base, `c-like.js`, which likely contains the rules for highlighting integer literals. The issue is that the pattern for recognizing `LL` suffixes is not correctly defined.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `LL` suffix is correctly recognized and highlighted. This involves modifying the regex pattern in the `c-like.js` file, which is not directly shown in the snippets but is imported by both `c.js` and `cpp.js`.\n\nAssuming the `c-like.js` file contains the regex patterns, the fix would look something like this:\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/c-like.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nconst INTEGER_SUFFIXES = '([uU]|[lL])?';\n=======\nconst INTEGER_SUFFIXES = '([uU]|[lL]{1,2})?';\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change ensures that both `L` and `LL` are correctly recognized as valid suffixes for integer literals. If the `c-like.js` file is not directly accessible, similar changes would need to be made in the relevant sections of `c.js` and `cpp.js` if they contain the regex patterns directly."
