        "explanation": "The issue is related to the syntax highlighting rules for C and C++ files. The default functions in 'c.js' and 'cpp.js' are responsible for defining how the syntax of C and C++ code is highlighted. Since the bug involves the incorrect highlighting of the 'LL' suffix, these functions need to be updated to correctly identify and highlight both 'L's in the 'LL' suffix when parsing the code.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug scenario involves incorrect syntax highlighting in C/C++ code for the 'LL' integer literal suffix. Only the first 'L' is highlighted instead of both, causing issues in readability and code understanding when viewed on platforms like StackOverflow."

        "explanation": "The bug is related to syntax highlighting in C and C++, specifically the incorrect handling of the 'LL' suffix for integer literals. The relevant classes and functions are responsible for defining and handling language highlighting rules. Since the issue pertains to how literals are highlighted, adjustments in these language definitions (in `src/languages/c.js` and `src/languages/cpp.js`) are necessary to ensure both 'L's in 'LL' are highlighted correctly.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue is incorrect syntax highlighting for the 'LL' integer literal suffix in C/C++. Only the first 'L' is highlighted instead of the entire 'LL'. This is seen in the provided screenshot, where 'LL' is not fully highlighted, leading to potential confusion for developers relying on syntax highlighting for code clarity."
