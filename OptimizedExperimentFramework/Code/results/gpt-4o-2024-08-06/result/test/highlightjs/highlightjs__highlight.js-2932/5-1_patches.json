    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Images and Root Cause\n\nThe images show how properties files handle multi-line values using a backslash (`\\`) to escape newlines. The issue arises when the last character is an escaped backslash (`\\\\`), which is common in Windows paths. The expected behavior is to correctly interpret the trailing backslash, but the current implementation fails to do so.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe bug is likely in the handling of the value parsing in the `src/languages/properties.js` file. The `DELIM_AND_VALUE` object defines how values are parsed, but it doesn't account for the case where a value ends with an escaped backslash.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `DELIM_AND_VALUE` object to correctly handle a trailing escaped backslash.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/properties.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            end: /$/,\n            relevance: 0,\n            contains: [\n              { begin: '\\\\\\\\n' }\n            ]\n=======\n            end: /(?<!\\\\\\\\)$/,\n            relevance: 0,\n            contains: [\n              { begin: '\\\\\\\\n' },\n              { begin: '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\$', relevance: 0 } // Handle trailing escaped backslash\n            ]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the `end` regex to ensure it doesn't prematurely terminate on a trailing escaped backslash and adds a new pattern to handle the specific case of a trailing `\\\\`."
