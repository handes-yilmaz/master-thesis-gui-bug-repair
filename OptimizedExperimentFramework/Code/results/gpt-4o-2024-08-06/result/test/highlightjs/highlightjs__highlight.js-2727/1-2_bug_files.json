        "explanation": "1. `src/languages/ecmascript.js` and `src/languages/javascript.js`: These files likely define the syntax rules for JavaScript and ECMAScript highlighting within `highlight.js`. If member functions are not highlighted correctly, the configuration in these files may need adjustment to properly include ES6 syntax.\n\n2. `src/lib/modes.js`: This file might be responsible for setting up various language modes and their respective rules for highlighting, indicating it may need adjustments if ES6 syntax isn't covered.\n\n3. `src/lib/highlight.js`: As the core of `highlight.js`, if enhancements to handle ES6 features specifically are needed, modifications may be necessary here to better support ES6 syntax highlighting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The issue described is related to JavaScript member functions in ES6 classes not being highlighted by the syntax highlighter `highlight.js` in a React application. The code provided uses `marked` with `highlight.js` to process markdown and render it inside a React component. The screenshot confirms that the JavaScript code syntax is not correctly highlighted, specifically the member functions within ES6 classes."

        "bug_scenario": "The bug entails member functions not being highlighted in ES6 classes when using highlight.js in a React application. The code uses highlight.js along with marked to render highlighted code blocks in markdown. However, when the code is rendered, member functions are not highlighted as expected."
