    "1/1": "To address the issue of member functions not being highlighted in ES6 classes, we need to ensure that the JavaScript language definition in the `highlight.js` library correctly identifies and highlights class methods. Let's analyze the provided code snippets and make the necessary adjustments.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Bug Scenario Image**: The image shows a React component with a `ScrollToTop` class, but the member functions like `changeScrollTopShow` and `scrollToTop` are not highlighted. This suggests that the syntax highlighting configuration for JavaScript is not recognizing these methods.\n\n2. **Bug Root Cause**: The `highlight.js` configuration for JavaScript might be missing a rule to identify and highlight class methods within ES6 classes.\n\n### Bug Code Snippets Analysis\n\n- **File: `src/languages/javascript.js`**: This file contains the JavaScript language definition for `highlight.js`. We need to ensure that it includes a rule for highlighting class methods.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nLet's add a rule to highlight class methods in the JavaScript language definition.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/javascript.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      {\n        beginKeywords: 'constructor',\n        end: /[\\{;]/,\n        excludeEnd: true,\n        contains: [\n          'self',\n          PARAMS\n        ]\n      },\n=======\n      {\n        beginKeywords: 'constructor',\n        end: /[\\{;]/,\n        excludeEnd: true,\n        contains: [\n          'self',\n          PARAMS\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        className: 'function',\n        begin: IDENT_RE + '\\\\s*(?=\\\\()',\n        relevance: 0\n      },\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Added Rule for Class Methods**: The new rule identifies a function by looking for an identifier (`IDENT_RE`) followed by an opening parenthesis `(`, which is typical for method definitions in classes. This rule is added after the constructor rule to ensure that class methods are recognized and highlighted.\n\nThis patch should enable `highlight.js` to correctly highlight member functions in ES6 classes."
