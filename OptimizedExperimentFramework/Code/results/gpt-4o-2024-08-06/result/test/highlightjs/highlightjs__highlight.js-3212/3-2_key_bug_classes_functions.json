        "explanation": "The 'NUMBER' constant in 'src/languages/elixir.js' defines the regular expression used to identify numbers in Elixir code. The absence of proper highlighting for '0' and numbers starting with '0' indicates an issue with the regular expression pattern defined in this constant. Adjusting this pattern will ensure that numbers like '0', '0123', and '0.3' are fully recognized and highlighted as numbers.",
        "bug_scenario": "The image shows a code snippet where various numbers are expected to be highlighted. However, the number '0' and numbers starting with '0', like '0123', are not highlighted as numbers, even though they should be. Only the decimal part of '0.x' numbers is highlighted, not the '0'."

        "bug_classes": [],
        "bug_functions": [
            "src/languages/elixir.js//NUMBER"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue lies in the regex pattern for numbers in the Elixir language definition. The 'NUMBER' object contains a regex pattern that determines how numbers are recognized and highlighted. The current pattern does not account for numbers starting with '0' or standalone '0', causing the highlighting issue. Adjusting this pattern will fix the number recognition problem.",
        "bug_scenario": "In the image, the numbers '0', '0123', '0.3', and '0.0' are not fully highlighted as numbers. This indicates that the number highlighting feature does not recognize these patterns correctly, especially when '0' is at the start or on its own."
