    "1/1": "To address the issue where `0` and numbers starting with `0` are not highlighted correctly in Elixir code, we need to modify the regular expression for numbers in the Elixir language definition. The current regex does not account for numbers starting with `0` correctly.\n\n### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe image shows that numbers like `0`, `0123`, and `0.3` are not fully highlighted as numbers. The root cause is the regex pattern used for matching numbers, which does not correctly handle numbers starting with `0`.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe bug is located in the `NUMBER` regex pattern in the `src/languages/elixir.js` file. We need to adjust the regex to correctly match numbers starting with `0`, including integers and floats.\n\n### Patch\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/elixir.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    begin: '(\\\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\\\b[1-9][0-9_]*(\\\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',\n    relevance: 0\n  };\n=======\n  const NUMBER = {\n    className: 'number',\n    begin: '(\\\\b0o[0-7_]+)|(\\\\b0b[01_]+)|(\\\\b0x[0-9a-fA-F_]+)|(-?\\\\b[0-9][0-9_]*(\\\\.[0-9_]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)?)',\n    relevance: 0\n  };\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the regex to allow numbers starting with `0`, ensuring that `0`, `0123`, and `0.3` are correctly highlighted as numbers."
