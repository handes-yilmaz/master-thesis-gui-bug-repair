        "explanation": "The issue is related to markdown processing, specifically with how bold and italics are parsed and rendered. The file `src/markdown.js` is likely responsible for parsing markdown syntax. Additionally, `src/languages/lib/css-shared.js` might be handling styling for the rendered output, impacting how the markdown format is applied visually. These files would likely need modifications to resolve the bold and italics misrendering issue.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect rendering of markdown when using combined bold and italics formatting. Instead of reverting back to normal text after the markdown symbols close, the text continues to render in bold and italics."

            "src/languages/markdown.js",
            "src/lib/regex.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue pertains to markdown syntax parsing, specifically related to handling bold and italics. Thus, the 'markdown.js' file in 'src/languages/' is likely involved as it handles parsing markdown syntax. Additionally, regex functions commonly aid in parsing tasks, so 'regex.js' in 'src/lib/' may also need examination to ensure correct regular expression handling for markdown formatting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves markdown rendering where text set to both bold and italics causes the entire document to render this way, failing to end the formatting correctly at the intended close markers. This affects the readability and formatting of the entire document."
