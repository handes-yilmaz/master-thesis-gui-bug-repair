    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report describes an issue with rendering Markdown text where applying both bold and italics to a piece of text causes the rest of the document to render incorrectly. The images show that after applying bold and italics, the formatting does not stop at the intended point, affecting subsequent text.\n\nThe root cause is likely in the Markdown parsing logic, where the combination of bold and italics is not properly closed, leading to the entire document being rendered with these styles.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe issue is likely in the `BOLD` and `ITALIC` definitions within the `src/languages/markdown.js` file. The `BOLD` and `ITALIC` objects have `contains` properties that might not be handling the nested formatting correctly, causing the parser to fail to recognize the end of the bold and italic sections.\n\n### Patch to Fix the Bug\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the parser correctly identifies the end of bold and italic formatting. This can be done by adjusting the `contains` logic to properly handle nested formatting.\n\n```javascript\n### src/languages/markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  const BOLD = {\n    className: 'strong',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /_{2}/,\n        end: /_{2}/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /\\*{2}/,\n        end: /\\*{2}/\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  const ITALIC = {\n    className: 'emphasis',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /\\*(?!\\*)/,\n        end: /\\*/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /_(?!_)/,\n        end: /_/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  BOLD.contains.push(ITALIC);\n  ITALIC.contains.push(BOLD);\n=======\n  const BOLD = {\n    className: 'strong',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /_{2}/,\n        end: /_{2}/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /\\*{2}/,\n        end: /\\*{2}/\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  const ITALIC = {\n    className: 'emphasis',\n    contains: [], // defined later\n    variants: [\n      {\n        begin: /\\*(?!\\*)/,\n        end: /\\*/\n      },\n      {\n        begin: /_(?!_)/,\n        end: /_/,\n        relevance: 0\n      }\n    ]\n  };\n  BOLD.contains.push(ITALIC);\n  ITALIC.contains.push(BOLD);\n\n  // Ensure proper closure of bold and italic\n  BOLD.contains.push(BOLD);\n  ITALIC.contains.push(ITALIC);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch ensures that the parser correctly identifies the end of bold and italic sections by allowing them to contain themselves, thus properly closing the formatting."
