        "explanation": "The issue is related to the markdown parsing logic in the file `src/languages/markdown.js`. The `BOLD` and `ITALIC` functions are responsible for detecting and applying bold and italics styles in markdown. The bug likely arises from how these functions handle nested or consecutive styling, causing them to fail to properly recognize closing markers. Adjustments to how `BOLD` and `ITALIC` manage their respective closures and interactions would address the misrendering.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect rendering of text when both bold and italics are applied using markdown. The problem causes the text following the bold and italics to also render as bold and italics, ignoring the closing characters. This is clearly shown in the images where text styling continues despite expected closure."

        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to the Markdown rendering of bold and italic text. The relevant code is in the `markdown.js` file, where the BOLD and ITALIC functionality is defined. The functions `BOLD` and `ITALIC` manage how these text styles are applied. The problem likely arises from how these functions interact, causing the styles to persist beyond their intended scope. The definitions and interactions within these functions need to be examined and adjusted to ensure proper termination of bold and italic styles.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves incorrect rendering of Markdown text when both bold and italics are applied. Specifically, applying bold and italics together causes the rest of the document to render as bold and italics, ignoring the closing markers for these styles."
