        "explanation": "1. **src/language-html/embed/angular-attributes.js**: This file handles the formatting of Angular attributes, which includes the logic for spacing around pipe arguments. Adjustments here can control how spaces are added or removed.\n\n2. **src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js**: This file deals with the interpolation of Angular expressions. It likely contains logic that affects how expressions within pipes are formatted, including spacing.\n\n3. **src/language-html/printer-html.js**: This file is responsible for the overall printing logic of HTML elements, including Angular-specific syntax. It may contain the logic that determines how spaces are applied around pipe arguments during the printing process.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves unwanted spaces being added around Angular pipe arguments in HTML templates. The expected behavior is to have no spaces around string or number arguments, but spaces are added, affecting readability and consistency with Angular documentation."
