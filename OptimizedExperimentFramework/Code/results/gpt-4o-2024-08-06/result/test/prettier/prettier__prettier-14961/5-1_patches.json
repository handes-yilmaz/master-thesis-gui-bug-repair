    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to revert the addition of spaces in Angular Pipes when the pipe arguments are strings or numbers. The bug scenario image shows that spaces are being added around the colon in the pipe arguments, which is not the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image and bug report indicate that the current formatting adds spaces around the colon in Angular Pipes, which is not consistent with the expected behavior. The expected behavior is to have no spaces around the colon when the pipe arguments are strings or numbers.\n\n### Bug Location Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippets are in the following files:\n\n1. `src/language-html/embed/angular-attributes.js`\n2. `src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js`\n\nThe function `printAngularInterpolation` in `angular-interpolation.js` is responsible for formatting the Angular interpolation, which includes handling the pipe arguments.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to modify the `printAngularInterpolation` function to ensure that spaces are not added around the colon for string or number arguments.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-html/embed/angular-interpolation.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            indent([\n              line,\n              await formatAttributeValue(part, textToDoc, {\n                parser: \"__ng_interpolation\",\n                __isInHtmlInterpolation: true, // to avoid unexpected `}}`\n                trailingComma: \"none\",\n              }),\n            ]),\n=======\n            indent([\n              line,\n              await formatAttributeValue(part.trim(), textToDoc, {\n                parser: \"__ng_interpolation\",\n                __isInHtmlInterpolation: true, // to avoid unexpected `}}`\n                trailingComma: \"none\",\n              }),\n            ]),\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification**: The `part.trim()` is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the pipe arguments, ensuring that no additional spaces are added around the colon for string or number arguments.\n- **Reasoning**: This change ensures that the formatting aligns with the expected behavior described in the bug report, where pipe arguments should not have spaces around the colon if they are strings or numbers."
