        "explanation": "1. **src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js**: This file likely contains the main logic for printing markdown, including handling whitespace. The issue with removing empty lines could be related to how this file processes and formats markdown content.\n\n2. **src/language-markdown/print-whitespace.js**: This file deals with whitespace handling in markdown. Since the bug is about the removal of empty lines, this file is crucial as it defines how whitespace, including line breaks, is treated during the formatting process.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the removal of empty lines in markdown YAML frontmatter when using Prettier 3.3.0. The expected behavior is that empty lines in the 'blogs' section should not be removed, but they are being removed in the output."
