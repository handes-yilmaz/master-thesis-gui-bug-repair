        "explanation": "The bug is related to the handling of whitespace and formatting in markdown files, specifically the removal of empty lines in YAML frontmatter. The files 'printer-markdown.js' and 'print-whitespace.js' in 'language-markdown' are the most directly involved in markdown formatting and whitespace handling, so they are likely locations where changes might influence how empty lines are preserved or removed. The 'whitespace-utils.js' file in 'utils' provides general utilities for whitespace management, making it relevant for addressing how blank lines are handled across different file types, including markdown.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves the removal of empty lines in the markdown YAML frontmatter when formatted using Prettier version 3.3.0. The bug report shows that the input markdown contains empty lines within the 'blogs' section, which are removed in the formatted output. The expected behavior is for these empty lines to be retained. The bug images do not provide additional relevant information for diagnosing the issue."

            "src/language-markdown/index.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "These files are related to how the markdown language is processed and printed in Prettier. The issue with empty lines suggests a problem in how the markdown parser or printer deals with formatting, likely located in the printer or options files since these would control output structure and formatting.",
        "bug_scenario": "Empty lines in markdown YAML frontmatter are being removed when they shouldn't be, causing formatting issues. The input includes several sections with empty lines between some elements, but the output generated by Prettier removes these empty lines, specifically in the 'blogs' section."
