        "explanation": "The parse function in `parser-markdown.js` is responsible for processing markdown files, including handling code blocks and HTML. The functions `transformInlineCode` and `mergeContinuousTexts` are likely involved in modifying the text structure, which could affect indentation. These functions may improperly handle or transform the text, causing the unwanted indentation changes on save.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug occurs when saving markdown files with nested code blocks or raw HTML. Each save adds extra indentation, particularly affecting HTML blocks. Prettier's format on save feature causes this issue, disrupting the intended structure and making the indentation incorrect."

        "bug_functions": [
            "src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js"
        ],
        "explanation": "The issue is related to how markdown and HTML code are parsed and formatted. The `parse` function in `parser-markdown.js` processes markdown files, and any misconfiguration here could affect how code blocks are handled. The functions `mergeContinuousTexts` and `transformInlineCode` are responsible for handling text nodes and inline code, which likely affect how nested structures are parsed. The `printer-markdown.js` file, although not expanded, is likely involved in formatting output, which directly affects the indentation issues described.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves indentation issues in markdown files when using the 'format on save' feature in VS Code with Prettier. Each time the file is saved, additional indentation is added to nested code blocks and raw HTML, leading to misalignment."
