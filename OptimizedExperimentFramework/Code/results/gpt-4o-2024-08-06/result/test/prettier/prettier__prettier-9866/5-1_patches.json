    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario Description and Root Cause\n\nThe bug scenario involves unstable JSX formatting when using the Unicode character `\\u3000` (an ideographic space). The issue is that the formatting of JSX elements is inconsistent, as shown in the provided image and bug report. The expected behavior is for the formatting to remain stable, but the presence of `\\u3000` causes the output to vary between runs.\n\nThe root cause of this issue is likely related to how the JSX printer handles whitespace and line breaks, particularly with non-standard spaces like `\\u3000`. The printer may not be correctly accounting for these spaces, leading to inconsistent formatting.\n\n### Bug Localization\n\nThe relevant code for handling JSX elements is located in the `src/language-js/print/jsx.js` file. The function `printJsxElementInternal` is responsible for printing JSX elements and managing whitespace and line breaks. This function needs to be adjusted to handle `\\u3000` consistently.\n\n### Patch Generation\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the JSX printer treats `\\u3000` as a regular space when determining line breaks and formatting. This can be done by updating the handling of whitespace in the `printJSXChildren` function.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/jsx.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction printJSXChildren(\n  path,\n  options,\n  print,\n  jsxWhitespace,\n  isFacebookTranslationTag\n) {\n  const n = path.getValue();\n  const children = [];\n\n  path.each((childPath, i) => {\n    const child = childPath.getValue();\n    if (isLiteral(child)) {\n      const text = rawText(child);\n\n      // Contains a non-whitespace character\n      if (isMeaningfulJSXText(child)) {\n        const words = text.split(matchJsxWhitespaceRegex);\n=======\nfunction printJSXChildren(\n  path,\n  options,\n  print,\n  jsxWhitespace,\n  isFacebookTranslationTag\n) {\n  const n = path.getValue();\n  const children = [];\n\n  path.each((childPath, i) => {\n    const child = childPath.getValue();\n    if (isLiteral(child)) {\n      const text = rawText(child).replace(/\\u3000/g, ' ');\n\n      // Contains a non-whitespace character\n      if (isMeaningfulJSXText(child)) {\n        const words = text.split(matchJsxWhitespaceRegex);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis patch replaces occurrences of `\\u3000` with a regular space before processing the text, ensuring consistent handling of whitespace in JSX elements."
