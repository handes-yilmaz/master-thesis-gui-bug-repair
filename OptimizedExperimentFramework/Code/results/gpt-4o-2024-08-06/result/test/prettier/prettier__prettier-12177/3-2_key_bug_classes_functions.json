        "explanation": "The function 'printSwitchCaseConsequent' is responsible for printing the consequent of a switch case. The bug is likely due to how it handles printing comments for 'default' cases differently from other cases, causing inconsistent formatting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves inconsistent formatting of comments within switch-case statements. In the 'default' case, the comment is moved to a new line instead of staying on the same line as in the other cases."

        "explanation": "The issue is related to how Prettier formats switch cases, particularly regarding comment placement. The function `printSwitchCaseConsequent` in `src/language-js/print/statement.js` is responsible for printing the case and default clauses of switch statements. This function likely contains logic that incorrectly places comments on a new line for default cases, causing the observed inconsistency in formatting.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug involves inconsistent handling of comments within switch case blocks in code formatting. Specifically, Prettier's output adds a new line after the comment in the default case, which differs from the expected behavior that keeps the comment inline with the default keyword."
