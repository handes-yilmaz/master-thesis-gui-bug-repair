    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that comments following `default:` in a `switch` statement are formatted consistently with `case:` comments. The problem is that the comment after `default:` is being moved to a new line, which is not the expected behavior.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image and bug report indicate that the `default:` case comment is being formatted differently than the `case:` comments. The expected behavior is for the comment to remain on the same line as `default:`.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue likely resides in the function responsible for printing switch case statements. We need to ensure that comments are handled consistently for both `case:` and `default:`.\n\n### Patch\n\nLet's modify the relevant function to ensure comments are printed correctly.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/print/statement.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nfunction printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print) {\n  return printStatementSequence(path, options, print, \"consequent\");\n}\n=======\nfunction printSwitchCaseConsequent(path, options, print) {\n  const node = path.getValue();\n  const parts = [];\n\n  if (node.type === \"SwitchCase\" && node.test === null) {\n    // Handle default case\n    parts.push(\"default: \");\n    if (hasComment(node, CommentCheckFlags.Leading)) {\n      parts.push(print([], { needsSemi: false }));\n    }\n  } else {\n    parts.push(printStatementSequence(path, options, print, \"consequent\"));\n  }\n\n  return parts;\n}\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Modification**: The `printSwitchCaseConsequent` function is updated to handle the `default:` case specifically. It checks if the `SwitchCase` node has a `null` test, indicating a `default:` case.\n- **Comment Handling**: If there is a leading comment, it is printed on the same line as `default:`.\n\nThis patch should ensure that comments following `default:` are formatted consistently with those following `case:`."
