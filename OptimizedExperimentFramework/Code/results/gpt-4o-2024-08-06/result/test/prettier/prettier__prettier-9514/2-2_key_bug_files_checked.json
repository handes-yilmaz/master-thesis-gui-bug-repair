        "explanation": "1. **src/language-js/parser-babel.js**: This file contains the current implementation of the Babel parser, which is being used for JavaScript parsing. To switch to Cherow, modifications would be needed here to integrate the new parser.\n\n2. **src/language-js/index.js**: This file manages the parsers available for JavaScript. To include Cherow, changes would be required to add it as an option and handle its integration alongside existing parsers like Babel and Flow.",
        "bug_scenario": "The bug report suggests using the Cherow parser for JavaScript in order to improve the speed of Prettier, especially in a format-on-save scenario. The benchmark image shows that Cherow is faster than other parsers like Babylon, which is currently being used. However, Cherow does not support Flow syntax, which is a limitation for its adoption."
