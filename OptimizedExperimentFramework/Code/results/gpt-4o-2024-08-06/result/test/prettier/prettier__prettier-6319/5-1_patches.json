    "1/1": "### Bug Scenario and Root Cause\n\nThe bug report indicates that the pipeline operator is expected to support both \"minimal\" and \"smart\" proposals. However, the current implementation only supports the \"minimal\" proposal, leading to a `SyntaxError` when using the \"smart\" proposal syntax (e.g., `5 |> # * 2`).\n\nThe root cause of the issue is that the Babel parser configuration in the code only includes the \"minimal\" proposal for the pipeline operator, and does not support the \"smart\" proposal.\n\n### Bug Location and Analysis\n\nThe relevant code snippet is in the `src/language-js/parser-babel.js` file. The `babelOptions` function configures the Babel parser plugins, and currently, it only includes the \"minimal\" proposal for the pipeline operator:\n\n```javascript\n[\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"minimal\" }]\n```\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to add support for the \"smart\" proposal as well.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo resolve the issue, we will modify the `babelOptions` function to include both \"minimal\" and \"smart\" proposals for the pipeline operator.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/parser-babel.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      [\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"minimal\" }],\n=======\n      [\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"minimal\" }],\n      [\"pipelineOperator\", { proposal: \"smart\" }],\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nThis change will allow the parser to support both \"minimal\" and \"smart\" proposals, addressing the reported issue."
