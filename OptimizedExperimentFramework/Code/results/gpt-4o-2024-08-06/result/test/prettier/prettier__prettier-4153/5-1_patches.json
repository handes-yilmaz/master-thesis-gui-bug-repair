    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that the language detection for fenced code blocks in Markdown ignores any attributes following the language identifier. This will allow Prettier to correctly format code blocks with attributes.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe provided image and bug report indicate that Prettier fails to detect the language of a fenced code block if there are non-whitespace characters following the language identifier. The expected behavior is for Prettier to ignore these characters and format the code block as if they were not present.\n\n### Bug Location and Fix\n\nThe issue likely resides in the Markdown parser, where the language of a code block is determined. We need to modify the parser to correctly identify the language even when additional attributes are present.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe'll make changes in the `src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js` file to handle this scenario.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-markdown/printer-markdown.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      return concat([\n        style,\n        node.lang || \"\",\n        hardline,\n        join(hardline, node.value.split(\"\\\\n\")),\n        hardline,\n        style\n      ]);\n=======\n      // Extract language ignoring any attributes\n      const lang = node.lang ? node.lang.split(/\\s+/)[0] : \"\";\n      return concat([\n        style,\n        lang,\n        hardline,\n        join(hardline, node.value.split(\"\\\\n\")),\n        hardline,\n        style\n      ]);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Search Block**: The original code simply uses `node.lang` to determine the language.\n- **Replace Block**: We split `node.lang` by whitespace and take the first element, which is the actual language identifier, ignoring any attributes that follow.\n\nThis change ensures that Prettier correctly identifies the language of a fenced code block, even when additional attributes are present, and formats it accordingly."
