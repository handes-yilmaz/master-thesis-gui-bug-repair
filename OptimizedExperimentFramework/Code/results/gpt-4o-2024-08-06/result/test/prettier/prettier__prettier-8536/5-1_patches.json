    "1/1": "To address the issue described in the bug report, we need to ensure that Prettier does not add an extra newline when a directive is followed by a comment. The problem is specifically related to the Babylon parser and occurs when the file ends with a directive and a comment.\n\n### Bug Scenario Analysis\n\nThe image and bug report indicate that Prettier is adding an extra newline after a directive followed by a comment. The expected behavior is to have a single newline, not two.\n\n### Bug Location\n\nThe issue likely resides in the handling of directives and comments in the `Program` node within the `printer-estree.js` file. The code snippet provided shows that an extra `hardline` is added if the next line is empty, which might be causing the extra newline.\n\n### Patch\n\nWe need to modify the logic to prevent adding an extra newline when a directive is followed by a comment. This can be done by adjusting the condition that checks for an empty next line.\n\n```javascript\n### src/language-js/printer-estree.js\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n          if (\n            isNextLineEmpty(\n              options.originalText,\n              childPath.getValue(),\n              options.locEnd\n            )\n          ) {\n            parts.push(hardline);\n          }\n=======\n          if (\n            isNextLineEmpty(\n              options.originalText,\n              childPath.getValue(),\n              options.locEnd\n            ) &&\n            !path.getNextSiblingNode()\n          ) {\n            parts.push(hardline);\n          }\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Condition Adjustment**: The condition now checks if there is a next sibling node. If there is no next sibling, it means the directive is followed by a comment, and we should not add an extra newline.\n- **Expected Outcome**: This change should ensure that only one newline is added after a directive followed by a comment, aligning with the expected behavior."
